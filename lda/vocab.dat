A
gun
is
a
normally
tubular
weapon
or
other
device
designed
to
discharge
projectiles
or
other
material.[1]
The
projectile
may
be
solid,
liquid,
gas
or
energy
and
may
be
free,
as
with
bullets
and
artillery
shells,
or
captive
as
with
Taser
probes
and
whaling
harpoons.
The
means
of
projection
varies
according
to
design
but
is
usually
effected
by
the
action
of
gas
pressure,
either
produced
through
the
rapid
combustion
of
a
propellant
or
compressed
and
stored
by
mechanical
means,
operating
on
the
projectile
inside
an
open-ended
tube
in
the
fashion
of
a
piston.
The
confined
gas
accelerates
the
movable
projectile
down
the
length
of
the
tube,
imparting
sufficient
velocity
to
sustain
the
projectile's
travel
once
the
action
of
the
gas
ceases
at
the
end
of
the
tube
or
muzzle.
Alternatively,
acceleration
via
electromagnetic
field
generation
may
be
employed
in
which
case
the
tube
may
be
dispensed
with
and
a
guide
rail
substituted.
The
first
devices
identified
as
guns
appeared
in
China
around
CE
1000.
By
the
12th
century
the
technology
was
spreading
through
the
rest
of
Asia,
and
into
Europe
by
the
13th
century
Most
guns
use
compressed
gas
confined
by
the
barrel
to
propel
the
bullet
up
to
high
speed,
though
devices
operating
in
other
ways
are
sometimes
called
guns.
In
firearms
the
high-pressure
gas
is
generated
by
combustion,
usually
of
gunpowder.
This
principle
is
similar
to
that
of
internal
combustion
engines,
except
that
the
bullet
leaves
the
barrel,
while
the
piston
transfers
its
motion
to
other
parts
and
returns
down
the
cylinder.
As
in
an
internal
combustion
engine,
the
combustion
propagates
by
deflagration
rather
than
by
detonation,
and
the
optimal
gunpowder,
like
the
optimal
motor
fuel,
is
resistant
to
detonation.
This
is
because
much
of
the
energy
generated
in
detonation
is
in
the
form
of
a
shock
wave,
which
can
propagate
from
the
gas
to
the
solid
structure
and
heat
or
damage
the
structure,
rather
than
staying
as
heat
to
propel
the
piston
or
bullet.
The
shock
wave
at
such
high
temperature
and
pressure
is
much
faster
than
that
of
any
bullet,
and
would
leave
the
gun
as
sound
either
through
the
barrel
or
the
bullet
itself
rather
than
contributing
to
the
bullet's
velocity.
The
term
gun
may
refer
to
any
sort
of
projectile
weapon
from
large
cannons
to
small
firearms
including
those
that
are
usually
hand-held
(handgun).[15]
The
word
gun
is
also
commonly
used
to
describe
objects
which,
while
they
are
not
themselves
weapons,
produce
an
effect
or
possess
a
form
which
is
in
some
way
evocative
of
a
handgun
or
long
gun.
The
use
of
the
term
"cannon"
is
interchangeable
with
"gun"
as
words
borrowed
from
the
French
language
during
the
early
15th
century,
from
Old
French
canon,
itself
a
borrowing
from
the
Italian
cannone,
a
"large
tube"
augmentative
of
Latin
canna
"reed
or
cane".[16]
Recent
scholarship
indicates
that
the
term
"gun"
may
have
its
origins
in
the
Norse
woman's
name
"Gunnildr"
(which
means
"War-sword")
(or
"Gunnild",
possibly
Queen
Gunhild
of
Wenden,
wife
of
King
Sweyn
Forkbeard[citation
needed]),
which
was
often
shortened
to
"Gunna".[17]
The
earliest
recorded
use
of
the
term
"gonne"
was
in
a
Latin
document
circa
1339.
Other
names
for
guns
during
this
era
were
"schioppi"
(Italian
translation-"thunderers"),
and
"donrebusse"
(Dutch
translation-"thunder
gun")
which
was
incorporated
into
the
English
language
as
"blunderbuss".[17]
Artillerymen
were
often
referred
to
as
"gonners"
and
"artillers"[18]
Early
guns
and
the
men
who
used
them
were
often
associated
with
the
devil
and
the
gunner's
craft
was
considered
a
black
art,
a
point
reinforced
by
the
smell
of
sulfur
on
battlefields
created
from
the
firing
of
guns
along
with
the
muzzle
blast
and
accompanying
flash
A
handgun
is
a
firearm
designed
to
be
handheld,
in
either
one
or
both
hands.
This
characteristic
differentiates
handguns
as
a
general
class
of
firearms
from
long
guns
such
as
rifles
and
shotguns
(which
usually
can
be
mounted
against
the
shoulder).
Major
handgun
subtypes
are
the
revolver
and
pistol
(including
single-shot
pistols,
semi-automatic
pistols,
and
machine
pistols);
other
subtypes
include
derringers
and
pepperboxes.
The
words
"pistol"
and
"handgun"
have
overlapping
variations
in
meaning.
Although
handgun
use
often
includes
bracing
with
a
second
hand,
the
essential
distinguishing
characteristic
of
a
handgun
is
its
facility
for
one-handed
operation
The
word
"pistol"
is
often
synonymous
with
the
word
"handgun".
Some
handgun
experts
make
a
technical
distinction
that
views
pistols
as
a
subset
of
handguns.
Sometimes
in
American
usage,
the
term
"pistol"
refers
to
a
handgun
having
one
chamber
integral
with
the
barrel,
making
pistols
distinct
from
the
other
main
type
of
handgun,
the
revolver,
which
has
a
revolving
cylinder
containing
multiple
chambers.
But
UK/Commonwealth
usage
often
does
not
make
this
distinction.
For
example,
the
official
designation
of
the
Webley
Mk
VI
was
"Pistol,
Revolver,
Webley
No.
1
Mk
VI",
and
the
designation
"Pistol
No.
2
Mk
I"
was
used
to
refer
to
both
the
Enfield
Revolver
and
the
later
Browning
Hi-Power
semi-automatic.[1][2][3][4]
Handheld
firearms
were
first
made
in
China
where
gunpowder
was
first
developed.
They
were
hand
cannons
(although
they
were
not
necessarily
fired
from
the
hand,
but
rather
at
the
end
of
a
handle).
By
the
14th
century,
they
existed
in
Europe
as
well.
The
first
handheld
firearms
that
might
better
be
called
"pistols"
were
made
as
early
as
the
15th
century,
but
their
creator
is
unknown.[5]
By
the
18th
century,
the
term
came
to
be
used
often
to
refer
to
handheld
firearms.
Practical
revolver
designs
appeared
in
the
19th
century,
but
it
was
not
until
the
mid-twentieth
century
that
the
(sometimes-observed)
differentiation
in
usage
of
the
words
"pistol"
and
"revolver"
evolved
among
some
speakers
and
the
use
of
"handgun"
became
prevalent.
Previously
there
had
been
no
such
differentiation,
and
in
fact
Samuel
Colt's
original
patent
was
for
a
"revolving-breech
pistol."
There
is
no
literal
equivalent
for
"handgun"
in
the
Romance
languages,
which
continue
to
use
cognates
of
the
word
"pistol".
Single-shot
pistols
are
the
simplest
possible
form
of
pistols
and
are
known
to
have
existed
in
AD
1365.[6]
The
earliest
handguns
were
single-shot,
muzzle-loading
guns
with
ignition
provided
by
inserting
a
smoldering
match
cord
into
a
touch
hole.
As
such,
they
were
essentially
nothing
more
than
miniature
cannon,
small
enough
to
be
handheld.
Improvements
followed
in
subsequent
centuries,
as
various
types
of
locks
(ignition
devices)
were
invented.
In
the
matchlock,
the
separate
match
cord
was
affixed
to
a
spring-loaded
pivot
which
could
be
tripped
by
a
trigger.
In
the
wheellock,
a
mechanism
analogous
to
that
used
in
today's
cigarette
lighters
replaced
the
smoldering
match
cord.
In
the
17th
century,
the
flintlock,
which
strikes
a
flint
against
steel,
appeared.
(The
flintlock,
amazingly,
remained
state-of-the-art
for
some
two
hundred
years.)
In
the
19th
century,
percussion
caps
were
developed,
followed
shortly
by
modern
integrated-primer
cartridges,
and
hammers
therefore
traded
their
flint
for
firing
pins.
An
example
of
a
single-shot
pistol
is
the
flare
gun.
Although
not
intended
to
be
a
weapon,
many
variants
have
been
made
(See
Flare
gun).
One
example
is
the
Kampfpistole,
or
Sturmpistole
in
its
final
form.
The
weapon
was
designed
to
function
as
an
anti-tank
weapon.[7]
Single-shot
pistols
continue
to
be
manufactured
today
and
are
often
used
for
target
shooting.
They
are
also
sometimes
used
for
handgun
hunting
of
game,
including
big
game.
The
most
powerful

Types
of
handguns[edit]
The
general
types
of
handguns
are
listed
below
in
their
order
of
historical
appearance.
Each
type
can
be
classified
into
many
subtypes.
Some
of
these
types
can
also
be
differently
classified
using
the
general
distinction
between
muzzle-loading
firearms
(loading
from
the
front
of
the
barrel)
and
breech-loading
firearms
(loading
from
behind
the
barrel).

Multi-barreled
pistols[edit]
Not
long
after
the
very
beginning
of
firearms,
inventors
began
experimenting
with
multi-barreled
weapons
in
the
quest
for
the
ability
to
fire
more
than
one
shot
before
needing
to
reload.
Not
surprisingly,
all
types
of
firearms
were
included
in
their
efforts,
from
volley
guns
to
analogously
devised
handguns.
Before
anyone
had
developed
a
practical
capability
for
delivering
multiple
loads
to
one
barrel
in
quick
succession
(which
is
how
repeating
fire
is
usually
accomplished
today),
gunsmiths
were
aggregating
multiple
loaded
barrels
into
one
place.
Some
examples
of
multi-barreled
pistols
are:
Duck's-foot
pistols
Derringers
Pepper-box
guns
(variously
referred
to
as
pepper-box
pistols
or
pepper-box
revolvers)
Howdah
pistols,
often
made
from
double-barrelled
rifles.
Revolvers[edit]

pistol,
the
longest
serving

pistol
of
the
U.S.
With
the
development
of
the
revolver
in
the
19th
century,
gunsmiths
had
finally
achieved
the
goal
of
a
practical
capability
for
delivering
multiple
loads
to
one
pistol
barrel
in
quick
succession.
Revolvers
feed
ammunition
via
the
rotation
of
a
cartridge-filled
cylinder,
in
which
each
cartridge
is
contained
in
its
own
ignition
chamber,
and
is
sequentially
brought
into
alignment
with
the
weapon's
barrel
by
an
indexing
mechanism
linked
to
the
weapon's
trigger
(double-action)
or
its
hammer
(single-action).
These
nominally
cylindrical
chambers,
usually
numbering
between
five
and
eight
depending
on
the
size
of
the
revolver
and
the
size
of
the
cartridge
being
fired,
are
bored
through
the
cylinder
so
that
their
axes
are
parallel
to
the
cylinder's
axis
of
rotation;
thus,
as
the
cylinder
rotates,
the
chambers
revolve
about
the
cylinder's
axis.

The
next
development
in
handgun
history
after
a
practical
revolver
was
the
development
of
the
semi-automatic
pistol,
which
uses
the
energy
of
one
shot
to
reload
the
next.
Typically
recoil
energy
from
a
fired
round
is
mechanically
harnessed;
however,
pistols
chambered
for
more
powerful
cartridges
may
be
gas
operated
(e.g.,
Desert
Eagle),
or
for
less
powerful
cartridges,
blowback.
After
a
round
is
fired,
the
pistol
will
cycle,
ejecting
the
spent
casing
and
chambering
a
new
round
from
the
magazine,
allowing
another
shot
to
take
place
immediately.
Some
terms
that
have
been,
or
still
are,
used
as
synonyms
for
"semi-automatic
pistol"
are
automatic
pistol,
autopistol,
autoloader,
self-loading
pistol
and
selfloader.
Machine
pistols[edit]
A
machine
pistol
is
generally
defined
as
a
firearm
designed
to
be
fired
with
one
hand,
and
capable
of
fully
automatic
or
selective
fire.
While
there
are
a
number
of
machine
pistols
such
as
the
Glock
18
and
later
models
of
the
Mauser
C96,
these
are
rare;
the
light
weight,
small
size,
and
extremely
rapid
rates
of
fire
of
a
machine
pistol
make
them
difficult
to
control,
making
the
larger
and
heavier
submachine
gun
a
better
choice
in
cases
where
the
small
size
of
a
machine
pistol
is
not
needed.
Most
machine
pistols
can
attach
a
shoulder
stock
(the
Heckler
&
Koch
VP70
would
only
fire
single
rounds
at
a
time
unless
the
stock
was
attached);
others,
such
as
the
Beretta
93R,
add
a
forward
handgrip.
Either
of
these
additions
technically
create
a
legal
non-pistol
under
the
US
National
Firearms
Act,
as
pistols
are
by
definition
designed
to
be
fired
with
one
hand.
The
addition
of
a
stock
or
forward
handgrip
is
considered
a
design
change
that
creates
either
a
short-barreled
rifle
or
any
other
weapon,
and
therefore
such
additions
are
generally
only
found
on
legal
machine

It
is
the
first
known
way
of
using
a
speedloader
in
a
handgun
Single-action
handguns
have
a
trigger
whose
sole
function
is
to
drop
a
pre-cocked
hammer
to
discharge
a
cartridge.
For
revolvers,
the
popular
Colt
Peacemaker
of
Old
West
fame
is
typically
thought
of.
Its
hammer
must
be
manually
cocked
for
each
shot.
For
auto-loading
pistols
the
Colt
1911
or
Browning
Hi-Power
are
typical
examples.
They
must
be
cocked
for
the
first
shot,
but
subsequent
shots
are
cocked
automatically
due
to
the
racking
of
the
slide.
These
types
of
guns
typically
have
a
very
light
and
crisp
trigger
pull,
making
for
more
accurate
target
shooting.
Traditional
double-action
handguns
have
a
mechanism
that
can
be
either
pre-cocked,
like
the
above
single-action
gun,
or
can
be
fired
with
the
gun
uncocked.
In
this
case,
the
gun
has
an
additional
mechanism
added
to
the
trigger
that
will
cock
the
gun
(and
rotate
the
cylinder
in
the
case
of
revolvers)
as
the
trigger
is
pulled.
Once
the
trigger
is
pulled
far
enough,
the
hammer
is
released
and
the
gun
fired.
For
autoloading
pistols
the
self-loading
mechanism
will
also
re-cock
the
hammer
after
the
first
shot
is
fired
so
that
subsequent
shots
are
fired
single-action.
For
revolvers,
each
shot
is
fired
with
the
hammer
initially
uncocked
unless
the
shooter
manually
cocked
the
gun.
Popular
auto
pistols
in
this
category
include
the
Walther
P38
and
Beretta
92.
These
guns
typically
have
a
longer,
heavier
trigger
pull
for
the
first
shot
then
light,
crisp
pulls
for
subsequent
shots.
Popular
revolvers
include
the
Ruger
Redhawk
and
Smith
&
Wesson
Model
29.
These
have
comparatively
long,
heavy
trigger
pulls
for
all
shots
unless
the
revolver
is
manually
cocked.
Double-action
only
handguns
do
not
have
the
ability
to
be
cocked
and
is
usually
evidenced
by
a
lack
of
either
the
hammer
spur
or
the
entire
hammer.
A
typical
autopistol
in
this
category
is
the
Ruger
KP93DAO
and
a
typical
revolver
is
the
Smith
&
Wesson
Centennial
or
the
Enfield
No
2
Mk
I*.
All
pistols
in
this
category
have
a
long,
heavy
trigger
pull
for
all
shots.
Pre-set
triggers
are
only
on
autoloading
pistols.
In
this
case
the
pistol
mechanism
is
always
partially
cocked
while
being
carried
and
during
firing.
The
partially
cocked
firing
pin
or
striker
is
not
cocked
enough
to
cause
an
accidental
release
to
discharge
a
cartridge,
adding
to
the
safety
of
the
design,
but
is
cocked
enough
to
remove
much
of
the
trigger
pull
and
weight
of
a
purely
double-action
pistol.
These
types
of
pistols
do
not
have
external
hammers
and
do
not
generally
have
a
decock
function.
Common
pistols
in
the
category
are
the
HS2000
(Springfield
XD)
and
the
various
forms
of
the
extremely
popular
Glock.
The
trigger
pull
of
these
guns
is
between
double-action
and
single-action
pistols.
Pre-set
triggers
may
or
may
not
have
a
second-strike
feature
on
a
dud
cartridge.
Some
automatic
pistol
models
such
as
the
HK
USP
Universal
Self-loading
Pistol
(or
U.S.P.)
come
in
a
variety
of
mechanism
types
and
can
be
easily
changed
by
a
gunsmith
for
both
left-
and
right-handed
shooters
and
for
different
operating
mechanism
and
safety
features.
Glock
introduced
a
new
"Safe
Action"
mechanism
that
is
neither
a
single
nor
double
action.[8]
The
weapon
is
never
"cocked"
in
terms
of
a
hammer
being
"cocked".
The
partly
tensioned
firing
pin
lock
is
released
by
pressing
the
trigger,
resulting
in
the
first
and
subsequent
trigger
pulls
all
being
the
same.

Advantages[edit]
In
comparison
to
long
guns
(rifles
and
shotguns),
handguns
are
smaller,
lighter,
and
easier
to
carry.
Since
firearms
do
not
rely
entirely
on
the
user's
strength,
they
put
weaker
individuals
on
an
equal
footing;
when
Colt
produced
the
first
practical
repeating
handgun,
it
gave
rise
to
the
saying
"God
created
men,
but
Colt
made
them
equal."[13][14]
Since
using
a
handgun,
at
a
minimum,
requires
one
hand
whereas
long
guns
often
require
both,
that
leaves
a
handgun
user
with
a
free
hand.
One
example
of
where
this
is
an
advantage
is
with
tactical
lights,
where
the
light
and
handgun
can
be
used
independently
or
in
coordination;
mounted
lights,
as
used
on
long
guns
and
submachine
guns,
don't
allow
the
light
to
be
pointed
independently
of
the
firearm.
In
addition,
handguns
can
be
more
easily
used
ambidextrously,
and
therefore
the
user
can
switch
firing
hands
depending
on
the
situation.
Another
important
tactical
consideration
is
maneuverability.
In
close
quarters,
an
opponent
could
more
easily
wrestle
a
long
gun's
muzzle
to
a
position
where
it
is
not
covering
him,
or
could
more
easily
wrestle
the
gun
away
from
its
owner,
whereas
a
handgun
offers
little
to
grab,
and
would
be
more
likely
to
still
be
covering
some
portion
of
the
opponent
during
the
struggle.[15]
Disadvantages[edit]
Handguns
are
often
considered
self-defense
weapons
for
use
under
50
yards
(46
m).
While
a
handgun
in
the
hands
of
an
experienced
shooter
may
be
effective
at
distances
greater
than
50
yards
(46
m),
a
handgun
cartridge
is
much
more
limited
in
its
energy
capacity
than
many
long
gun
cartridges.
Many
handgun
cartridges
are
optimized
for
best
performance
from
shorter
barrels
than
typically
found
in
rifles.[16]
Many
rifles
are
able
to
achieve
bullet
velocities
of
over
3,000
ft/s
(914
m/s),
but
rounds
for
handguns
are
rarely
capable
of
achieving
velocities
over
1,500
ft/s
(457
m/s).
Thus,
long
guns
are
generally
more
powerful
at
any
range,
and
especially
more
effective
at
longer
ranges
than
handguns.
Because
of
the
pistol's
seemingly
low
power,
many
ballistic
vest
and
armor
have
the
capability
of
stopping
pistol
bullets.
This
is
largely
due
to
both
facts
that
pistols
have
shorter
barrel,
producing
a
reduced
rifling,
and
the
shape
of
the
nose,
which
also
reduces
penetration.
These
problems
also
apply
to
submachine
guns.
Demonstration
project
armor
issued
by
NIJ
was
designed
to
ensure
a
95
percent
probability
of
survival
after
being
hit
with
a
.38
caliber
and
the
widely
used
9mm
bullet
at
a
velocity
of
800
ft/s.
Furthermore,
the
probability
of
requiring
surgery
if
hit
by
a
projectile
was
to
be
10
percent
or
less.[17]
A
shooter
is
generally
able
to
achieve
considerably
greater
accuracy
with
a
long
gun
than
with
a
handgun.
This
is
due
to
several
aspects,
such
as:
The
longer
distance
between
the
rear
and
front
sights
of
a
long
gun
makes
for
better
aim.
The
larger
size
of
a
long
gun
allows
a
shooter
to
get
a
more
stable
hold.
A
long
gun
also
achieves
a
higher
muzzle
velocity,
which
reduces
the
bullet
travel
time
and
thus
reduces
external
effects
on
the
bullet
such
as
gravitational
drop
and
wind.
Longer
barrels
also
means
more
bullet
spin
attained
while
in
the
barrel,
to
improve
the
geometric
accuracy
of
the
moment
of
inertia.
Handguns
and
gun
politics[edit]
Main
article:
Gun
politics
Many
handgun
models
are
easily
concealed
on
a
person—a
trait
that
is
useful
both
to
people
wishing
to
bear
arms
for
self-protection
and
to
criminals
wishing
to
carry
a
handgun
for
illegal
purposes.
For
these
reasons,
handguns
are
a
particular
focus
of
debates
on
gun
politics,
and
in
many
jurisdictions
both
keeping
and
bearing
them
is
much
more
heavily
regulated
than
with
long
guns.
Australia[edit]
Civilian
ownership
of
handguns
in
Australia
is
legal,
but
heavily
restricted.
Handguns
may
not
be
owned
for
self-defense
purposes
(Target
shooting,
collecting,
and
occupational
reasons
for
farmers/gun
dealers
are,
by
and
large,
the
only
legal
reasons
for
handgun
ownership),
and
anyone
wishing
to
possess
a
handgun
must
obtain
a
firearms
license
and
observe
stringent
storage
regulations.
Calibre
for
handguns
is
limited
to
.38;
however,
calibres
up
to
.45
may
be
obtained
with
a
permit
for
certain
disciplines
such
as
Metallic
Silhouette.
Minimum
barrel
lengths
are
imposed
for
handguns
with
4"
for
Revolvers
and
4.72"(120
mm)
for
Semi-Automatic
Pistols.
Pistol
magazines
with
a
capacity
of
over
10
rounds
are
restricted
to
collectors,
security
guards
and
firearms
dealers.
Canada[edit]
In
Canada,
ownership
of
handguns
is
restricted
and
subject
to
registration.
Guns
with
a
barrel
length
of
105
mm
(about
4.14
inches)
or
less
and
handguns
that
fire
.25
or
.32
caliber
ammunition
are
classified
as
prohibited
with
certain
International
Sporting
Handgun
exceptions.[18]
Some
users
are
allowed
to
possess
a
handgun
or
rifle
classified
as
prohibited
(automatic
and
certain
semi
automatic
firearms)
if
the
firearm
was
owned
and
registered
before
the
law
came
into
effect
on
December
1,
1998.[19]
A
Possession
and
Acquisition
or
a
Possession
Only
Licence
is
required
to
own
all
firearms.
Permits
to
carry
concealed
weapons
are
rarely,
if
ever,
granted
to
non-law
enforcement
personnel.[20]
Czech
Republic[edit]
Main

in
the
Czech
Republic
It
is
possible
to
buy
and
own
a
gun
for
collecting,
sporting,
gamekeeping,
occupation
(private
security,
money
transport)
and
self-defense
purposes.
Unlike
most
countries
in
Europe,
in
the
Czech
Republic
right
to
carry
a
concealed
handgun
is
a
natural
part
of
self-defense
gun
license
owner,
after
formal
approval
(no
justification
is
needed)
is
written
in
the
gun
license.
Germany[edit]
Owning
a
handgun
in
Germany
is
legal
with
a
firearm
ownership
license
(Waffenbesitzkarte).
The
license
is
shall-issue
for
applicants
who
have
met
all
requirements
for
it,
which
include
a
clean
criminal
background,
proof
of
purchase
of
a
gun
safe,
passing
a
test
about
handling
and
laws
regarding
firearms,
and
providing
a
genuine
reason
for
owning
the
gun.
While
self-defence
is
usually
not
accepted
as
a
valid
cause
for
gun
ownership,
sports
shooting,
having
a
hunting
license
and
collecting,
are.
Handguns
with
a
caliber
of
less
than
6,3
mm
are
banned,
except
those
built
for
rimfire
ammunition
and
those
built
before
January
1,
1970.
Carrying
a
handgun
(and
any
other
firearm)
is
legal
with
a
firearm
carrying
permit
(Waffenschein).
It
is
only
issued
when
the
applicant
shows
exceptionally
good
reason
why
they
are
in
danger
(Politicians,
businessmen,
etc..).
Israel[edit]
In
Israel,
handguns
are
the
only
type
of
firearms
that
most
private
citizens
may
own.
They
are
licensed
for
self-defense
purposes
to
eligible
individuals.
Current
regulations
limit
licenses
to
one
handgun
and
50
cartridges
per
licensee.
Few
places
are
off
limits
to
handguns
in
Israel.
Carrying
of
loaded
handguns,
openly
or
concealed,
is
slightly
more
common
than
other
countries.

(April
2013)
In
Italy,
private
ownership
of
handguns
is
legal
and
allowed
under
any
gun
license,
as
for
any
other
firearm;
as
such,
handguns
can
be
purchased
by
all
individuals
who
hold
a
gun
license
of
any
kind,
even
a
hunting
license,
although
handgun
hunting
is
not
allowed
in
Italy.
The
law
imposes
limits
to
the
number
of
handguns
that
can
be
owned,
according
to
their
destination
of
use:
the
maximum
limit
is
three
handguns
listed
as
"Common
firearms"
(those
normally
employable
for
self-defense
and
other
uses)
and
up
to
six
handguns
listed
as
"Sporting
firearms"
(those
specifically
engineered
and
manufactured
for
target
competitions).
Owners
of
handguns,
and
any
other
firearm,
under
a
collector's
license
may
exceed
limits
and
own
an
unlimited
number
of
handguns,
but
may
not
own
ammunition
for
them
and
may
not
use
them
under
any
situation.
The
concealed
carry
of
a
handgun
for
personal
defense
purposes
is
instead
illegal
unless
the
individual
is
granted
a
specific
license
(Porto
d'armi
per
difesa
personale,
"Self-Defense
firearms
carry
license")
which
is
extremely
hard
to
obtain
and
is
released
only
to
those
who
can
demonstrate
to
have
a
justified
reason,
and
a
factual
and
unarguable
need,
to
carry
a
concealed
firearm
for
self-defense;
such
license
has
to
be
renewed
yearly,
whereas
all
other
gun
licenses,
which
allow
the
purchase,
ownership
and
transport,
yet
not
the
carry,
of
handguns,
have
a
5-years
or
6-years
expiry
date.
Owners
of
handguns
under
any
other
license
than
a
concealed
carry
license
are
allowed
to
detain
the
firearm
at
home
or
in
any
of
their
premises
for
property
defense,
or
to
transport
it
unloaded,
locked
in
a
container
and
possibly
partially
stripped,
to
a
shooting
range
or
to
any
other
location
where
target
practice
or
recreational
shooting
can
be
safely
practiced,
but
are
not
allowed
to
carry
their
firearm
for
self-defense,
either
open
or
concealed,
nor
to
keep
it
loaded
for
any
reason
in
any
place
other
than
their
home
or
any
of
their
premises,
or
outside
of
an
authorized
shooting
range.
Some
individuals,
such
as
magistrates
and
high-rank
military
and
Law
Enforcement
officials,
don't
need
a
license
to
privately
procure
and
carry
a
concealed
handgun
for
self-defense;
Police
officers
under
such
high
ranks
are
authorized
to
carry
their
service
pistol
off-duty,
with
their
Police
ID
being
the
sole
document
needed,
while
they
need
a
standard
Concealed
Carry
license
for
the
off-duty
carry
of
non-issue
firearm
(on-duty
carry
of
non-issue
firearms
is
illegal
for
Police
personnel
in
Italy);
it
should
be
noted
anyway
that
even
Police
personnel
is
seldom,
if
ever,
granted
a
Concealed
Carry
license,
they
are
generally
considered
to
"not
need"
it,
being
authorized
to
carry
to
the
off-duty
of
their
issue
handgun.
Private
security
personnel
is
generally
issued
a
2-years-valid
license
allowing
to
carry
firearms
(both
handguns
and
long
guns)
for
service
and
self-defense,
authorizing
also
open
carry,
which
is
otherwise
forbidden
to
civilians
in
the
Country.
Kenya[edit]
In
Kenya,
private
ownership
of
certain
types
of
firearms
and
ammunition
is
legal
under
the
Firearms
Act
(cap.
114),
laws
of
Kenya.
Applicants
for
a
gun
owner’s
licence
in
Kenya
are
required
by
law
to
show
genuine
reason
for
wanting
to
possess
a
firearm.
Reasons
such
as
intention
of
using
the
firearm
in
target
shooting,
for
protection
or
for
personal
security
are
often
the
ones
given
by
gun
license
applicants.
Anyone
as
young
as
12
can
actually
apply
for
gun
ownership
under
the
aforementioned
Kenyan
law.
However,
an
applicant
for
a
firearm

Pakistan[edit]
Main
article:
gun
politics
in
Pakistan
In
Pakistan,
citizens
in
the
states
of
Punjab
and
Sindh
are
subject
to
strict
gun
control
regulations
and
may
only
carry
a
concealed
gun,
even
if
it
is
with
a
bodyguard.
Display
of
armory
in
public
is
banned,
with
fines
of
up
to
50,000
Rupees.
Citizens
must
also
register
guns
and
obtain
licenses
for
them.
In
addition,
for
concealed
carry,
permits
are
also
required
which
are
issued
separately
by
the
home
ministry
of
each
province.
Banned
weapons
are
called
prohibited-bore
weapons
which
are
calibers
above
0.44
in
handguns
and
0.222
in
rifles
plus
all
automatic
weapons.
Licenses
are
issued
for
these
in
specific
circumstances
but
only
by
the
approval
of
the
Prime
Minister
of
Pakistan.[citation

United
Kingdom[edit]
In
the
United
Kingdom
(with
the
exception
of
Northern
Ireland),
civilian
ownership
of
almost
any
handgun
has
been
outlawed
since
the
Dunblane
massacre
of
1996;
the
only
exclusions
were
single-shot,
rimfire,
and
muzzleloading
pistols/revolvers.
So
called
"long
barreled"
cartridge-firing
revolvers
and
semiautomatic
pistols
(.22LR
only)
are
still
legal
providing
that
they
meet
the
following
requirements:
overall
length
not
less
than
24
inches,
barrel
length
not
less
than
12
inches.
As
with
all
other
legal
firearms
in
the
UK,
possession
requires
a
Firearm
Certificate.
The
application
and
vetting
process
is
carried
out
by
the
local
police
force
and
is
very
in
depth.
Good
reason
(justification)
for
holding
a
firearm
certificate
in
the
UK
would
be
target
shooting
(as
part
of
a
Home
Office
Approved
Club)
or
hunting.
"Self-defence"
or
other
reasons
of
this
nature
are
not
allowed.
The
open
carrying
of
any
firearm
in
a
public
place
is
illegal
in
the
UK
unless
you
have
a
valid
reason
to
do
so,
this
also
requires
that
you
carry
it
in
a
gun
carry
case.
Concealed
carry
of
any
firearm
in
a
public
place
would
normally
be
illegal,
unless
authorised
by
a
firearms
licence.
Air
pistols
are
still
legal,
however,
those
with
energy
levels
over
6
foot
pounds
(8
joules)
(half
the
limit
for
air
rifles,
which
is
12
foot
pound
or
16.25
joules)
are
classified
as
firearms.[21][22][23]

A
gun
is
a
normally
tubular
weapon
or
other
device
designed
to
discharge
projectiles
or
other
material.[1]
The
projectile
may
be
solid,
liquid,
gas
or
energy
and
may
be
free,
as
with
bullets
and
artillery
shells,
or
captive
as
with
Taser
probes
and
whaling
harpoons.
The
means
of
projection
varies
according
to
design
but
is
usually
effected
by
the
action
of
gas
pressure,
either
produced
through
the
rapid
combustion
of
a
propellant
or
compressed
and
stored
by
mechanical
means,
operating
on
the
projectile
inside
an
open-ended
tube
in
the
fashion
of
a
piston.
The
confined
gas
accelerates
the
movable
projectile
down
the
length
of
the
tube,
imparting
sufficient
velocity
to
sustain
the
projectile's
travel
once
the
action
of
the
gas
ceases
at
the
end
of
the
tube
or
muzzle.
Alternatively,
acceleration
via
electromagnetic
field
generation
may
be
employed
in
which
case
the
tube
may
be
dispensed
with
and
a
guide
rail
substituted.
The
first
devices
identified
as
guns
appeared
in
China
around
CE
1000.
By
the
12th
century
the
technology
was
spreading
through
the
rest
of
Asia,
and
into
Europe
by
the
13th
century.[2]

Etymology
The
origin
of
the
English
word
gun
is
considered
to
derive
from
the
name
given
to
a
particular
historical
weapon.
Domina
Gunilda
was
the
name
given
to
a
remarkably
large
ballista,
a
mechanical
bolt
throwing
weapon
of
enormous
size,
mounted
at
Windsor
Castle
during
the
14C.
This
name
in
turn
may
have
derived
from
the
Old
Norse
woman's
proper
name
Gunnhildr
which
combines
two
Norse
words
referring
to
battle.[3]
In
any
case
the
term
gonne
or
gunne
was
applied
to
early
hand-held
firearms
by
the
late
14C.
or
early
15C.

The
first
device
identified
as
a
gun,
a
bamboo
tube
that
used
gunpowder
to
fire
a
spear,
appeared
in
China
around
AD
1000.[2]
The
Chinese
had
previously
invented
gunpowder
in
the
9th
century.[4][5][6]
An
early
type
of
firearm
(or
portable
gun)
is
the
fire
lance,
a
black-powder–filled
tube
attached
to
the
end
of
a
spear
and
used
as
a
flamethrower;
shrapnel
was
sometimes
placed
in
the
barrel
so
that
it
would
fly
out
together
with
the
flames.[6][7]
The
earliest
depiction
of
a
gunpowder
weapon
is
the
illustration
of
a
fire-lance
on
a
mid-10th
century
silk
banner
from
Dunhuang.[8]
The
De'an
Shoucheng
Lu,
an
account
of
the
siege
of
De'an
in
1132,
records
that
Song
forces
used
fire-lances
against
the
Jurchens.[9]
In
due
course,
the
proportion
of
saltpeter
in
the
propellant
was
increased
to
maximise
its
explosive
power.[7]
To
better
withstand
that
explosive
power,
the
paper
and
bamboo
of
which
fire-lance
barrels
were
originally
made
came
to
be
replaced
by
metal.[6]
And
to
take
full
advantage
of
that
power,
the
shrapnel
came
to
be
replaced
by
projectiles
whose
size
and
shape
filled
the
barrel
more
closely.[7]
With
this,
we
have
the
three
basic
features
of
the
gun:
a
barrel
made
of
metal,
high-nitrate
gunpowder,
and
a
projectile
which
totally
occludes
the
muzzle
so
that
the
powder
charge
exerts
its
full
potential
in
propellant
effect.[10]
One
theory
of
how
gunpowder
came
to
Europe
is
that
it
made
its
way
along
the
Silk
Road
through
the
Middle
East;
another
is
that
it
was
brought
to
Europe
during
the
Mongol
invasion
in
the
first
half
of
the
13th
century.[11][12]

the
English

in
1346.[13]
The
earliest
surviving
firearm
in
Europe
has
been
found
from
Otepää,
Estonia
and
it
dates
to
at
least
1396.[14]
Around
the
late
14th
century
in
Europe,
smaller
and
portable
hand-held
cannons
were
developed,
creating
in
effect
the
first
smooth-bore
personal
firearm.
In
the
late
15th
century
the
Ottoman
empire
used
firearms
as
part
of
its
regular
infantry.
The
first
successful
rapid-fire
firearm
is
the
Gatling
Gun,
invented
by
Richard
Gatling
and
fielded
by
the
Union
forces
during
the
American
Civil
War
in
the
1860s.
The
world's
first
sub-machine
gun
(a
fully
automatic
firearm
which
fires
pistol
cartridges)
able
to
be
maneuvered
by
a
single
soldier
is
the
MP18.1,
invented
by
Theodor
Bergmann.
It
was
introduced
into
service
in
1918
by
the
German
Army
during
World
War
I
as
the
primary
weapon
of
the
Stosstruppen
(assault
groups
specialized
in
trench
combat).
The
first
assault
rifle
was
introduced
during
World
War
II
by
the
Germans,
known
as
the
StG44.
It
was
the
first
firearm
which
bridges
the
gap
between
long
range
rifles,
machine
guns,
and
short
range
sub-machine
guns.
Since
the
mid-20th
century
guns
that
fire
beams
of
energy
rather
than
solid
projectiles
have
been
developed,
and
also
guns
that
can
be
fired
by
means
other
than
the
use
of
gunpowder.
Operating
principle
Most
guns
use
compressed
gas
confined
by
the
barrel
to
propel
the
bullet
up
to
high
speed,
though
devices
operating
in
other
ways
are
sometimes
called
guns.
In
firearms
the
high-pressure
gas
is
generated
by
combustion,
usually
of
gunpowder.
This
principle
is
similar
to
that
of
internal
combustion
engines,
except
that
the
bullet
leaves
the
barrel,
while
the
piston
transfers
its
motion
to
other
parts
and
returns
down
the
cylinder.
As
in
an
internal
combustion
engine,
the
combustion
propagates
by
deflagration
rather
than
by
detonation,
and
the
optimal
gunpowder,
like
the
optimal
motor
fuel,
is
resistant
to
detonation.
This
is
because
much
of
the
energy
generated
in
detonation
is
in
the
form
of
a
shock
wave,
which
can
propagate
from
the
gas
to
the
solid
structure
and
heat
or
damage
the
structure,
rather
than
staying
as
heat
to
propel
the
piston
or
bullet.
The
shock
wave
at
such
high
temperature
and
pressure
is
much
faster
than
that
of
any
bullet,
and
would
leave
the
gun
as
sound
either
through
the
barrel
or
the
bullet
itself
rather
than
contributing
to
the
bullet's
velocity.
Components
Barrel
Rifling
of
a
105
mm
Royal
Ordnance
L7
tank
gun.
Barrel
types
include
rifled—a
series
of
spiraled
grooves
or
angles
within
the
barrel—when
the
projectile
requires
an
induced
spin
to
stabilize
it,
and
smoothbore
when
the
projectile
is
stabilized
by
other
means
or
rifling
is
undesired
or
unnecessary.
Typically,
interior
barrel
diameter
and
the
associated
projectile
size
is
a
means
to
identify
gun
variations.
Bore
diameter
is
reported
in
several
ways.
The
more
conventional
measure
is
reporting
the
interior
diameter
(bore)
of
the
barrel
in
decimal
fractions
of
the
inch
or
in
millimetres.
Some
guns—such
as
shotguns—report
the
weapon's
gauge
(which
is
the
number
of
shot
pellets
having
the
same
diameter
as
the
bore
produced
from
one
English
pound
(454g)
of
lead)
or—as
in
some
British
ordnance—the
weight
of
the
weapon's
usual
projectile.
Projectile
A
gun
projectile
may
be
a
simple,
single-piece
item
like
a
bullet,
a
casing
containing
a
payload
like
a
shotshell
or
explosive
shell,
or
complex
projectile
like
a
sub-caliber
projectile
and
sabot.
The
propellant
may
be
air,
an
explosive
solid,
or
an
explosive
liquid.
Some
variations
like
the
Gyrojet
and
certain
other
types
combine
the
projectile
and
propellant
into
a
single
item.
Terminology
The
term
gun
may
refer
to
any
sort
of
projectile
weapon
from
large
cannons
to
small
firearms
including
those
that
are
usually
hand-held
(handgun).[15]
The
word
gun
is
also
commonly
used
to
describe
objects
which,
while
they
are
not
themselves
weapons,
produce
an
effect
or
possess
a
form
which
is
in
some
way
evocative
of
a
handgun
or
long
gun.
The
use
of
the
term
"cannon"
is
interchangeable
with
"gun"
as
words
borrowed
from
the
French
language
during
the
early
15th
century,
from
Old
French
canon,
itself
a
borrowing
from
the
Italian
cannone,
a
"large
tube"
augmentative
of
Latin
canna
"reed
or
cane".[16]
Recent
scholarship
indicates
that
the
term
"gun"
may
have
its
origins
in
the
Norse
woman's
name
"Gunnildr"
(which
means
"War-sword")
(or
"Gunnild",
possibly
Queen
Gunhild
of
Wenden,
wife
of
King
Sweyn
Forkbeard[citation
needed]),
which
was
often
shortened
to
"Gunna".[17]
The
earliest
recorded
use
of
the
term
"gonne"
was
in
a
Latin
document
circa
1339.
Other
names
for
guns
during
this
era
were
"schioppi"
(Italian
translation-"thunderers"),
and
"donrebusse"
(Dutch
translation-"thunder
gun")
which
was
incorporated
into
the
English
language
as
"blunderbuss".[17]
Artillerymen
were
often
referred
to
as
"gonners"
and
"artillers"[18]
Early
guns
and
the
men
who
used
them
were
often
associated
with
the
devil
and
the
gunner's
craft
was
considered
a
black
art,
a
point
reinforced
by
the
smell
of
sulfur
on
battlefields
created
from
the
firing
of
guns
along
with
the
muzzle
blast
and
accompanying
flash.[19]
The
word
cannon
is
retained
in
some
cases
for
the
actual
gun
tube
but
not
the
weapon
system.
The
title
gunner
is
applied
to
the
member
of
the
team
charged
with
operating,
aiming,
and
firing
a
gun.
Autocannons
are
automatic
guns
designed
primarily
to
fire
shells
and
are
mounted
on
a
vehicle
or
other
mount.
Machine
guns
are
similar,
but
usually
designed
to
fire
simple
projectiles.
In
some
calibers
and
some
usages,
these
two
definitions
overlap.
In
contemporary
military
and
naval
parlance
the
term
gun
has
a
very
specific
meaning
and
refers
solely
to
any
large-calibre,
direct-fire,
high-velocity,
flat-trajectory
artillery
piece
employing
an
explosive-filled
hollowed
metal
shell
or
solid
bolt
as
its
primary
projectile.[citation
needed]
This
later
usage
contrasts
with
large-calibre,
high-angle,
low-velocity,
indirect-fire
weapons
such
as
howitzers,
mortars,
and
grenade
launchers
which
invariantly
employ
explosive-filled
shells.
In
other
military
use,
the
term
"gun"
refers
primarily
to
direct
fire
weapons
that
capitalize
on
their
muzzle
velocity
for
penetration
or
range.
In
modern
parlance,
these
weapons
are
breech-loaded
and
built
primarily
for
long
range
fire
with
a
low
or
almost
flat
ballistic
arc.
A
variation
is
the
howitzer
or
gun-howitzer
designed
to
offer
the
ability
to
fire
both
low
or
high-angle
ballistic
arcs.
In
this
use,
example
guns
include
naval
guns.
A
less
strict
application
of
the
word
is
to
identify
one
artillery
weapon
system
or
non-machine
gun
projectile
armament
on
aircraft.
A
related
military
use
of
the
word
is
in
describing
gun-type
fission
weapon.
In
this
instance,
the
"gun"
is
part
of
a
nuclear
weapon
and
contains
an
explosively
propelled
sub-critical
slug
of
fissile
material
within
a
barrel
to
be
fired
into
a
second
sub-critical
mass
in
order
to
initiate
the
fission
reaction.
Potentially
confused
with
this
usage
are
small
nuclear
devices
capable
of
being
fired
by
artillery
or
recoilless
rifle.
In
civilian
use,
the
captive
bolt
pistol
is
used
in
agriculture
to
humanely
stun
farm
animals
for
slaughter.[20]
Shotguns
are
normally
civilian
weapons
used
primarily
for
hunting.
These
weapons
are
typically
smooth
bored
and
fire
a
shell
containing
small
lead
or
steel
balls.
Variations
use
rifled
barrels
or
fire
other
projectiles
including
solid
lead
slugs,
a
Taser
XREP
projectile
capable
of
stunning
a
target,
or
other
payloads.
In
military
versions,
these
weapons
are
often
used
to
burst
door
hinges
or
locks
in
addition
to
antipersonnel
uses.
very
A
handgun
is
a
firearm
designed
to
be
handheld,
in
either
one
or
both
hands.
This
characteristic
differentiates
handguns
as
a
general
class
of
firearms
from
long
guns
such
as
rifles
and
shotguns
(which
usually
can
be
mounted
against
the
shoulder).
Major
handgun
subtypes
are
the
revolver
and
pistol
(including
single-shot
pistols,
semi-automatic
pistols,
and
machine
pistols);
other
subtypes
include

The
words
"pistol"
and
"handgun"
have
overlapping
variations
in
meaning.
Although
handgun
use
often
includes
bracing
with
a
second
hand,
the
essential
distinguishing
characteristic
of
a
handgun
is
its
facility
for
one-handed
operation.

Nomenclature

Multiple
senses
of
the
word
"pistol"[edit]
SIG
Pro
semi-automatic
pistol
The
word
"pistol"
is
often
synonymous
with
the
word
"handgun".
Some
handgun
experts
make
a
technical
distinction
that
views
pistols
as
a
subset
of
handguns.
Sometimes
in
American
usage,
the
term
"pistol"
refers
to
a
handgun
having
one
chamber
integral
with
the
barrel,
making
pistols
distinct
from
the
other
main
type
of
handgun,
the
revolver,
which
has
a
revolving
cylinder
containing
multiple
chambers.
But
UK/Commonwealth
usage
often
does
not
make
this
distinction.
For
example,
the
official
designation
of
the
Webley
Mk
VI
was
"Pistol,
Revolver,
Webley
No.
1
Mk
VI",
and
the
designation
"Pistol
No.
2
Mk
I"
was
used
to
refer
to
both
the
Enfield
Revolver
and
the
later
Browning
Hi-Power
semi-automatic.[1][2][3][4]
Handheld
firearms
were
first
made
in
China
where
gunpowder
was
first
developed.
They
were
hand
cannons
(although
they
were
not
necessarily
fired
from
the
hand,
but
rather
at
the
end
of
a
handle).
By
the
14th
century,
they
existed
in
Europe
as
well.
The
first
handheld
firearms
that
might
better
be
called
"pistols"
were
made
as
early
as
the
15th
century,
but
their
creator
is
unknown.[5]
By
the
18th
century,
the
term
came
to
be
used
often
to
refer
to
handheld
firearms.
Practical
revolver
designs
appeared
in
the
19th
century,
but
it
was
not
until
the
mid-twentieth
century
that
the
(sometimes-observed)
differentiation
in
usage
of
the
words
"pistol"
and
"revolver"
evolved
among
some
speakers
and
the
use
of
"handgun"
became
prevalent.
Previously
there
had
been
no
such
differentiation,
and
in
fact
Samuel
Colt's
original
patent
was
for
a
"revolving-breech
pistol."
There
is
no
literal
equivalent
for
"handgun"
in
the
Romance
languages,
which
continue
to
use
cognates
of
the
word
"pistol".
Types
of
handguns[edit]
The
general
types
of
handguns
are
listed
below
in
their
order
of
historical
appearance.
Each
type
can
be
classified
into
many
subtypes.
Some
of
these
types
can
also
be
differently
classified
using
the
general
distinction
between
muzzle-loading
firearms
(loading
from
the
front
of
the
barrel)
and
breech-loading
firearms
(loading
from
behind
the
barrel).
Single-shot
pistols[edit]
Hand
cannon
from
the
Chinese
Yuan
Dynasty
(1271–1368).
Western
European
handgun,
circa
AD
1380.
It
is
18
cm
long
and
weighs
1.04
kg.
It
was
fixed
to
a
wooden
handle
to
facilitate
manipulation
(e.g.,
aiming;
holding
while
firing;
holding
while
hot).
(Musée
de
l'Armée.)
Single-shot
pistols
are
the
simplest
possible
form
of
pistols
and
are
known
to
have
existed
in
AD
1365.[6]
The
earliest
handguns
were
single-shot,
muzzle-loading
guns
with
ignition
provided
by
inserting
a
smoldering
match
cord
into
a
touch
hole.
As
such,
they
were
essentially
nothing
more
than
miniature
cannon,
small
enough
to
be
handheld.
Improvements
followed
in
subsequent
centuries,
as
various
types
of
locks
(ignition
devices)
were
invented.
In
the
matchlock,
the
separate
match
cord
was
affixed
to
a
spring-loaded
pivot
which
could
be
tripped
by
a
trigger.
In
the
wheellock,
a
mechanism
analogous
to
that
used
in
today's
cigarette
lighters
replaced
the
smoldering
match
cord.
In
the
17th
century,
the
flintlock,
which
strikes
a
flint
against
steel,
appeared.
(The
flintlock,
amazingly,
remained
state-of-the-art
for
some
two
hundred
years.)
In
the
19th
century,
percussion
caps
were
developed,
followed
shortly
by
modern
integrated-primer
cartridges,
and
hammers
therefore
traded
their
flint
for
firing
pins.
An
example
of
a
single-shot
pistol
is
the
flare
gun.
Although
not
intended
to
be
a
weapon,
many
variants
have
been
made
(See
Flare
gun).
One
example
is
the
Kampfpistole,
or
Sturmpistole
in
its
final
form.
The
weapon
was
designed
to
function
as
an
anti-tank
weapon.[7]
Single-shot
pistols
continue
to
be
manufactured
today
and
are
often
used
for
target
shooting.
They
are
also
sometimes
used
for
handgun
hunting
of
game,
including
big
game.
The
most
powerful
handguns
are
capable
of
killing
all
game,
including
elephants.
Multi-barreled
pistols[edit]
Not
long
after
the
very
beginning
of
firearms,
inventors
began
experimenting
with
multi-barreled
weapons
in
the
quest
for
the
ability
to
fire
more
than
one
shot
before
needing
to
reload.
Not
surprisingly,
all
types
of
firearms
were
included
in
their
efforts,
from
volley
guns
to
analogously
devised
handguns.
Before
anyone
had
developed
a
practical
capability
for
delivering
multiple
loads
to
one
barrel
in
quick
succession
(which
is
how
repeating
fire
is
usually
accomplished
today),
gunsmiths
were
aggregating
multiple
loaded
barrels
into
one
place.
Some
examples
of
multi-barreled
pistols
are:
Duck's-foot
pistols
Derringers
Pepper-box
guns
(variously
referred
to
as
pepper-box
pistols
or
pepper-box
revolvers)
Howdah
pistols,
often
made
from
double-barrelled
rifles.
Revolvers[edit]

Colt

pistol,
the
longest

pistol
of
the
U.S.
With
the
development
of
the
revolver
in
the
19th
century,
gunsmiths
had
finally
achieved
the
goal
of
a
practical
capability
for
delivering
multiple
loads
to
one
pistol
barrel
in
quick
succession.
Revolvers
feed
ammunition
via
the
rotation
of
a
cartridge-filled
cylinder,
in
which
each
cartridge
is
contained
in
its
own
ignition
chamber,
and
is
sequentially
brought
into
alignment
with
the
weapon's
barrel
by
an
indexing
mechanism
linked
to
the
weapon's
trigger
(double-action)
or
its
hammer
(single-action).
These
nominally
cylindrical
chambers,
usually
numbering
between
five
and
eight
depending
on
the
size
of
the
revolver
and
the
size
of
the
cartridge
being
fired,
are
bored
through
the
cylinder
so
that
their
axes
are
parallel
to
the
cylinder's
axis
of
rotation;
thus,
as
the
cylinder
rotates,
the
chambers
revolve
about
the
cylinder's
axis.

The
next
development
in
handgun
history
after
a
practical
revolver
was
the
development
of
the
semi-automatic
pistol,
which
uses
the
energy
of
one
shot
to
reload
the
next.
Typically
recoil
energy
from
a
fired
round
is
mechanically
harnessed;
however,
pistols
chambered
for
more
powerful
cartridges
may
be
gas
operated
(e.g.,
Desert
Eagle),
or
for
less
powerful
cartridges,
blowback.
After
a
round
is
fired,
the
pistol
will
cycle,
ejecting
the
spent
casing
and
chambering
a
new
round
from
the
magazine,
allowing
another
shot
to
take
place
immediately.
Some
terms
that
have
been,
or
still
are,
used
as
synonyms
for
"semi-automatic
pistol"
are
automatic
pistol,
autopistol,
autoloader,
self-loading
pistol
and
selfloader.
Machine
pistols[edit]
A
machine
pistol
is
generally
defined
as
a
firearm
designed
to
be
fired
with
one
hand,
and
capable
of
fully
automatic
or
selective
fire.
While
there
are
a
number
of
machine
pistols
such
as
the
Glock
18
and
later
models
of
the
Mauser
C96,
these
are
rare;
the
light
weight,
small
size,
and
extremely
rapid
rates
of
fire
of
a
machine
pistol
make
them
difficult
to
control,
making
the
larger
and
heavier
submachine
gun
a
better
choice
in
cases
where
the
small
size
of
a
machine
pistol
is
not
needed.
Most
machine
pistols
can
attach
a
shoulder
stock
(the
Heckler
&
Koch
VP70
would
only
fire
single
rounds
at
a
time
unless
the
stock
was
attached);
others,
such
as
the
Beretta
93R,
add
a
forward
handgrip.
Either
of
these
additions
technically
create
a
legal
non-pistol
under
the
US
National
Firearms
Act,
as
pistols
are
by
definition
designed
to
be
fired
with
one
hand.
The
addition
of
a
stock
or
forward
handgrip
is
considered
a
design
change
that
creates
either
a
short-barreled
rifle
or
any
other
weapon,
and
therefore
such
additions
are
generally
only
found
on
legal
machine
guns.

Single-action
handguns
have
a
trigger
whose
sole
function
is
to
drop
a
pre-cocked
hammer
to
discharge
a
cartridge.
For
revolvers,
the
popular
Colt
Peacemaker
of
Old
West
fame
is
typically
thought
of.
Its
hammer
must
be
manually
cocked
for
each
shot.
For
auto-loading
pistols
the
Colt
1911
or
Browning
Hi-Power
are
typical
examples.
They
must
be
cocked
for
the
first
shot,
but
subsequent
shots
are
cocked
automatically
due
to
the
racking
of
the
slide.
These
types
of
guns
typically
have
a
very
light
and
crisp
trigger
pull,
making
for
more
accurate
target
shooting.
Traditional
double-action
handguns
have
a
mechanism
that
can
be
either
pre-cocked,
like
the
above
single-action
gun,
or
can
be
fired
with
the
gun
uncocked.
In
this
case,
the
gun
has
an
additional
mechanism
added
to
the
trigger
that
will
cock
the
gun
(and
rotate
the
cylinder
in
the
case
of
revolvers)
as
the
trigger
is
pulled.
Once
the
trigger
is
pulled
far
enough,
the
hammer
is
released
and
the
gun
fired.
For
autoloading
pistols
the
self-loading
mechanism
will
also
re-cock
the
hammer
after
the
first
shot
is
fired
so
that
subsequent
shots
are
fired
single-action.
For
revolvers,
each
shot
is
fired
with
the
hammer
initially
uncocked
unless
the
shooter
manually
cocked
the
gun.
Popular
auto
pistols
in
this
category
include
the
Walther
P38
and
Beretta
92.
These
guns
typically
have
a
longer,
heavier
trigger
pull
for
the
first
shot
then
light,
crisp
pulls
for
subsequent
shots.
Popular
revolvers
include
the
Ruger
Redhawk
and
Smith
&
Wesson
Model
29.
These
have
comparatively
long,
heavy
trigger
pulls
for
all
shots
unless
the
revolver
is
manually
cocked.
Double-action
only
handguns
do
not
have
the
ability
to
be
cocked
and
is
usually
evidenced
by
a
lack
of
either
the
hammer
spur
or
the
entire
hammer.
A
typical
autopistol
in
this
category
is
the
Ruger
KP93DAO
and
a
typical
revolver
is
the
Smith
&
Wesson
Centennial
or
the
Enfield
No
2
Mk
I*.
All
pistols
in
this
category
have
a
long,
heavy
trigger
pull
for
all
shots.
Pre-set
triggers
are
only
on
autoloading
pistols.
In
this
case
the
pistol
mechanism
is
always
partially
cocked
while
being
carried
and
during
firing.
The
partially
cocked
firing
pin
or
striker
is
not
cocked
enough
to
cause
an
accidental
release
to
discharge
a
cartridge,
adding
to
the
safety
of
the
design,
but
is
cocked
enough
to
remove
much
of
the
trigger
pull
and
weight
of
a
purely
double-action
pistol.
These
types
of
pistols
do
not
have
external
hammers
and
do
not
generally
have
a
decock
function.
Common
pistols
in
the
category
are
the
HS2000
(Springfield
XD)
and
the
various
forms
of
the
extremely
popular
Glock.
The
trigger
pull
of
these
guns
is
between
double-action
and
single-action
pistols.
Pre-set
triggers
may
or
may
not
have
a
second-strike
feature
on
a
dud
cartridge.
Some
automatic
pistol
models
such
as
the
HK
USP
Universal
Self-loading
Pistol
(or
U.S.P.)
come
in
a
variety
of
mechanism
types
and
can
be
easily
changed
by
a
gunsmith
for
both
left-
and
right-handed
shooters
and
for
different
operating
mechanism
and
safety
features.
Glock
introduced
a
new
"Safe
Action"
mechanism
that
is
neither
a
single
nor
double
action.[8]
The
weapon
is
never
"cocked"
in
terms
of
a
hammer
being
"cocked".
The
partly
tensioned
firing
pin
lock
is
released
by
pressing
the
trigger,
resulting
in
the
first
and
subsequent
trigger
pulls
all
being
the
same.

Advantages[edit]
In
comparison
to
long
guns
(rifles
and
shotguns),
handguns
are
smaller,
lighter,
and
easier
to
carry.
Since
firearms
do
not
rely
entirely
on
the
user's
strength,
they
put
weaker
individuals
on
an
equal
footing;
when
Colt
produced
the
first
practical
repeating
handgun,
it
gave
rise
to
the
saying
"God
created
men,
but
Colt
made
them
equal."[13][14]
Since
using
a
handgun,
at
a
minimum,
requires
one
hand
whereas
long
guns
often
require
both,
that
leaves
a
handgun
user
with
a
free
hand.
One
example
of
where
this
is
an
advantage
is
with
tactical
lights,
where
the
light
and
handgun
can
be
used
independently
or
in
coordination;
mounted
lights,
as
used
on
long
guns
and
submachine
guns,
don't
allow
the
light
to
be
pointed
independently
of
the
firearm.
In
addition,
handguns
can
be
more
easily
used
ambidextrously,
and
therefore
the
user
can
switch
firing
hands
depending
on
the
situation.
Another
important
tactical
consideration
is
maneuverability.
In
close
quarters,
an
opponent
could
more
easily
wrestle
a
long
gun's
muzzle
to
a
position
where
it
is
not
covering
him,
or
could
more
easily
wrestle
the
gun
away
from
its
owner,
whereas
a
handgun
offers
little
to
grab,
and
would
be
more
likely
to
still
be
covering
some
portion
of
the
opponent
during
the
struggle.[15]
Disadvantages[edit]
Handguns
are
often
considered
self-defense
weapons
for
use
under
50
yards
(46
m).
While
a
handgun
in
the
hands
of
an
experienced
shooter
may
be
effective
at
distances
greater
than
50
yards
(46
m),
a
handgun
cartridge
is
much
more
limited
in
its
energy
capacity
than
many
long
gun
cartridges.
Many
handgun
cartridges
are
optimized
for
best
performance
from
shorter
barrels
than
typically
found
in
rifles.[16]
Many
rifles
are
able
to
achieve
bullet
velocities
of
over
3,000
ft/s
(914
m/s),
but
rounds
for
handguns
are
rarely
capable
of
achieving
velocities
over
1,500
ft/s
(457
m/s).
Thus,
long
guns
are
generally
more
powerful
at
any
range,
and
especially
more
effective
at
longer
ranges
than
handguns.
Because
of
the
pistol's
seemingly
low
power,
many
ballistic
vest
and
armor
have
the
capability
of
stopping
pistol
bullets.
This
is
largely
due
to
both
facts
that
pistols
have
shorter
barrel,
producing
a
reduced
rifling,
and
the
shape
of
the
nose,
which
also
reduces
penetration.
These
problems
also
apply
to
submachine
guns.
Demonstration
project
armor
issued
by
NIJ
was
designed
to
ensure
a
95
percent
probability
of
survival
after
being
hit
with
a
.38
caliber
and
the
widely
used
9mm
bullet
at
a
velocity
of
800
ft/s.
Furthermore,
the
probability
of
requiring
surgery
if
hit
by
a
projectile
was
to
be
10
percent
or
less.[17]
A
shooter
is
generally
able
to
achieve
considerably
greater
accuracy
with
a
long
gun
than
with
a
handgun.
This
is
due
to
several
aspects,
such
as:
The
longer
distance
between
the
rear
and
front
sights
of
a
long
gun
makes
for
better
aim.
The
larger
size
of
a
long
gun
allows
a
shooter
to
get
a
more
stable
hold.
A
long
gun
also
achieves
a
higher
muzzle
velocity,
which
reduces
the
bullet
travel
time
and
thus
reduces
external
effects
on
the
bullet
such
as
gravitational
drop
and
wind.
Longer
barrels
also
means
more
bullet
spin
attained
while
in
the
barrel,
to
improve
the
geometric
accuracy
of
the
moment
of
inertia.
Handguns
and
gun
politics[edit]
Main
article:
Gun
politics
Many
handgun
models
are
easily
concealed
on
a
person—a
trait
that
is
useful
both
to
people
wishing
to
bear
arms
for
self-protection
and
to
criminals
wishing
to
carry
a
handgun
for
illegal
purposes.
For
these
reasons,
handguns
are
a
particular
focus
of
debates
on
gun
politics,
and
in
many
jurisdictions
both
keeping
and
bearing
them
is
much
more
heavily
regulated
than
with
long
guns.
Australia[edit]
Civilian
ownership
of
handguns
in
Australia
is
legal,
but
heavily
restricted.
Handguns
may
not
be
owned
for
self-defense
purposes
(Target
shooting,
collecting,
and
occupational
reasons
for
farmers/gun
dealers
are,
by
and
large,
the
only
legal
reasons
for
handgun
ownership),
and
anyone
wishing
to
possess
a
handgun
must
obtain
a
firearms
license
and
observe
stringent
storage
regulations.
Calibre
for
handguns
is
limited
to
.38;
however,
calibres
up
to
.45
may
be
obtained
with
a
permit
for
certain
disciplines
such
as
Metallic
Silhouette.
Minimum
barrel
lengths
are
imposed
for
handguns
with
4"
for
Revolvers
and
4.72"(120
mm)
for
Semi-Automatic
Pistols.
Pistol
magazines
with
a
capacity
of
over
10
rounds
are
restricted
to
collectors,
security
guards
and
firearms
dealers.
Canada[edit]
In
Canada,
ownership
of
handguns
is
restricted
and
subject
to
registration.
Guns
with
a
barrel
length
of
105
mm
(about
4.14
inches)
or
less
and
handguns
that
fire
.25
or
.32
caliber
ammunition
are
classified
as
prohibited
with
certain
International
Sporting
Handgun
exceptions.[18]
Some
users
are
allowed
to
possess
a
handgun
or
rifle
classified
as
prohibited
(automatic
and
certain
semi
automatic
firearms)
if
the
firearm
was
owned
and
registered
before
the
law
came
into
effect
on
December
1,
1998.[19]
A
Possession
and
Acquisition
or
a
Possession
Only
Licence
is
required
to
own
all
firearms.
Permits
to
carry
concealed
weapons
are
rarely,
if
ever,
granted
to
non-law
enforcement
personnel.[20]
The
Gatling
gun
is
one
of
the
best-known
early
rapid-fire
weapons
and
a
forerunner
of
the
modern
machine
gun.
Invented
by
Richard
Gatling,
it
is
known
for
its
use
by
the
Union
forces
during
the
American
Civil
War
in
the
1860s,
which
was
the
first
time
it
was
employed
in
combat.
Later
it
was
used
in
the
Boshin
War,
the
Anglo-Zulu
War
and
still
later
in
the
assault
on
San
Juan
Hill
during
the
Spanish–American
War.[1]
The
Gatling
gun's
operation
centered
on
a
cyclic
multi-barrel
design
which
facilitated
cooling
and
synchronized
the
firing-reloading
sequence.
Each
barrel
fired
a
single
shot
when
it
reached
a
certain
point
in
the
cycle,
after
which
it
ejected
the
spent
cartridge,
loaded
a
new
round
and,
in
the
process,
allowed
the
barrel
to
cool
somewhat.
This
configuration
allowed
higher
rates
of
fire
to
be
achieved
without
the
barrel
overheating.

History[edit]
Patent
drawing
for
R.J.
Gatling's
"battery
gun",
9
May
1865.
The
Gatling
gun
was
designed
by
the
American
inventor
Dr.
Richard
J.
Gatling
in
1861
and
patented
on
November
4,
1862.[2][3]
Gatling
wrote
that
he
created
it
to
reduce
the
size
of
armies
and
so
reduce
the
number
of
deaths
by
combat
and
disease,
and
to
show
how
futile
war
is.[4]
Although
the
first
Gatling
gun
was
capable
of
firing
continuously,
it
required
a
person
to
crank
it;
therefore
it
was
not
a
true
automatic
weapon.
The
Maxim
gun,
invented
and
patented
in
1883,
was
the
first
true
fully
automatic
weapon,
making
use
of
the
fired
projectile's
recoil
force
to
reload
the
weapon.
Nonetheless,
the
Gatling
gun
represented
a
huge
leap
in
firearm
technology.
Prior
to
the
Gatling
gun,
the
only
weapons
available
to
militaries,
capable
of
firing
many
projectiles
in
a
short
space
of
time,
were
mass-firing
volley
weapons
like
the
French
Reffye
mitrailleuse
in
1870–1871,
and
field
cannons
firing
canister
shot,
much
like
a
very
large
shotgun.
The
latter
were
widely
used
during
and
after
the
Napoleonic
Wars.
Although
the
maximum
rate
of
fire
was
increased
by
firing
multiple
projectiles
simultaneously,
these
weapons
still
needed
to
be
reloaded
after
each
discharge,
which
for
multi-barrel
systems
like
the
mitrailleuse
was
cumbersome
and
time-consuming.
This
negated
much
of
the
advantage
of
their
high
rate
of
fire
per
discharge,
making
them
much
less
powerful
on
the
battlefield.
In
comparison,
the
Gatling
gun
offered
a
rapid
and
continuous
rate
of
fire
without
having
to
be
manually
reloaded
by
opening
the
breech.
The
original
Gatling
gun
was
a
field
weapon
which
used
multiple
rotating
barrels
turned
by
a
hand
crank,
and
firing
loose
(no
links
or
belt)
metal
cartridge
ammunition
using
a
gravity
feed
system
from
a
hopper.
The
Gatling
gun's
innovation
lay
in
the
use
of
multiple
barrels
to
limit
overheating,
a
rotating
mechanism,
and
a
gravity-feed
reloading
system,
which
allowed
unskilled
operators
to
achieve
a
relatively
high
rate
of
fire
of
200
rounds
per
minute.[3]
American
Civil
War
and
the
Americas[edit]
The
Gatling
gun
was
first
used
in
warfare
during
the
American
Civil
War.
Twelve
of
the
guns
were
purchased
personally
by
Union
commanders
and
used
in
the
trenches
during
the
siege
of
Petersburg,
Virginia
(June
1864
–
April
1865).[5]
Eight
other
Gatling
guns
were
fitted
on
gunboats.[6]
The
gun
was
not
accepted
by
the
American
Army
until
1866,
but
a
sales
representative
of
the
manufacturing
company
demonstrated
it
in
combat.[7]
(In
this
period,
specifically
July
17,
1863,
Gatling
guns
were
used
to
over-awe
New
York
anti-draft
rioters.[8])
Captain
Germán
Astete
of
the
Peruvian
Navy
took
with
him
dozens
of
Gatling
guns
from
the
United
States
to
Peru
in
December
1879
during
the
Peru-Chile
War
of
the
Pacific.
Gatling
guns
were
used
by
the
Peruvian
Navy
and
Army,
especially
in
the
Battle
of
Tacna
(May
1880)
and
the
Battle
of
San
Juan
(January
1881)
against
the
invading
Chilean
Army.
Lieutenant
A.L.
Howard
of
the
Connecticut
National
Guard
had
an
interest
in
the
company
manufacturing
Gatling
guns,
and
took
a
personally
owned
Gatling
gun
to
Saskatchewan,
Canada,
in
1885
for
use
with
the
Canadian
military
against
Métis
patriotes
during
Louis
Riel's
North-West
Rebellion.[7]
Early
multi-barrel
guns
were
approximately
the
size
and
weight
of
artillery
pieces,
and
were
often
perceived
as
a
replacement
for
cannons
firing
grapeshot
or
canister
shot.[7]
Gatling
guns
were
even
mounted
aboard
ships.
Compared
with
earlier
weapons
such
as
the
mitrailleuse,
which
required
manual
reloading,
the
Gatling
gun
was
more
reliable
and
easier
to
operate,
and
had
a
lower,
but
continuous
rate
of
fire.
The
large
wheels
required
to
move
these
guns
around
required
a
high
firing
position,
which
increased
the
vulnerability
of
their
crews.[7]
Sustained
firing
of
gunpowder
cartridges
generated
a
cloud
of
smoke,
making
concealment
impossible
until
smokeless
powder
became
available
in
the
late
19th
century.[9]
When
in
use
against
troops
of
industrialized
nations,
operators
of
Gatling
guns
could
be
engaged
by
artillery
they
could
not
reach
and
targeted
by
snipers
they
could
not
see.[7]
In
Africa
and
Asia[edit]
Two

Gatling
guns
from
the
Second
Anglo-Afghan
War
The
Gatling
gun
was
used
most
successfully
to
expand
European
colonial
empires
by
killing
warriors
of
non-industrialized
societies
mounting
massed
attacks,
including
the
Matabele,
the
Zulu,
the
Bedouins,
and
the
Mahdists.[7]
Imperial
Russia
purchased
400
Gatling
guns
and
used
them
against
Turkmen
cavalry
and
other
nomads
of
central
Asia.[10]
The
Royal
Navy
used
Gatling
guns
against
the
Egyptians
at
Alexandria
in
1882.[9]
The
first
use
of
the
Gatling
by
the
British
Army
was
in
the
Afghan
war
at
the
Battle
of
Charasia
in
October
1879.[citation

Spanish–American
War[edit]
Further
information:
Spanish–American
War
Because
of
infighting
within
army
ordnance,
Gatling
guns
were
again
used
by
the
U.S.
Army
during
the
Spanish–American
War.[11]
A
four-gun
battery
of
Model
1895
ten-barrel
Gatling
guns
in
.30
Army
made
by
Colt's
Arms
Company
was
formed
into
a
separate
detachment
led
by
Lt.
John
"Gatling
Gun"
Parker.[12]
The
detachment
proved
very
effective,
supporting
the
advance
of
American
forces
at
the
Battle
of
San
Juan
Hill,
where
three
of
the
Gatlings
with
swivel
mountings
were
used
with
great
success
against
the
Spanish
defenders.[13]
During
the
American
charge
up
San
Juan
and
Kettle
hills,
the
three
guns
fired
a
total
of
18,000
.30
Army
rounds
in
8
1/2
minutes
(an
average
of
over
700
rounds
per
minute
per
gun)
against
Spanish
troop
positions
along
the
crest
of
both
hills,
wreaking
terrible
carnage.[13]
Despite
this
remarkable
achievement,
the
Gatling's
weight
and
cumbersome
artillery
carriage
hindered
its
ability
to
keep
up
with
infantry
forces
over
difficult
ground,
particularly
in
Cuba,
where
roads
were
often
little
more
than
jungle
footpaths.
By
this
time,
the
U.S.
Marines
had
been
issued
the
modern
tripod-mounted
M1895
Colt–Browning
machine
gun
using
the
6mm
Lee
Navy
round,
which
they
employed
to
defeat
the
Spanish
infantry
at
the
battle
of
Cuzco
Wells.
Basic
design[edit]
The
M134
Minigun
is
a
7.62x51
mm
NATO,
six-barrel
machine
gun
with
a
high
rate
of
fire
(2,000
to
6,000
rounds
per
minute).
It
features
Gatling-style
rotating
barrels
with
an
external
power
source,
normally
an
electric
motor.
The
"Mini"
in
the
name
is
in
comparison
to
designs
that
use
a
similar
firing
mechanism
but
larger
shells,
such
as
General
Electric's
earlier
20-millimeter
M61
Vulcan,
and
"gun"
for
a
caliber
size
smaller
than
that
of
a
cannon,
typically
20
mm
and
higher.
The
Minigun
is
used
by
several
branches
of
the
U.S.
military.
Versions
are
designated
M134
and
XM196
by
the
United

Army,
and
GAU-2/A
and
GAU-17/A
by
the
U.S.
Air

and
U.S.

"Minigun"
refers
to
a
specific
model
of
weapon
that
General
Electric
originally
produced,
but
the
term
"minigun"
has
popularly
come
to
refer
to
any
externally
powered
Gatling
gun
of
rifle
caliber.
The
term
is
also
used
to
refer
to
guns
of
similar
rates
of
fire
and
configuration
regardless
of
power
source
and
caliber.

History[edit]
Background:
electrically
driven
Gatling
gun[edit]
The
ancestor
to
the
modern
minigun
was
made
in
the
1860s.
Richard
Jordan
Gatling
replaced
the
hand-cranked
mechanism
of
a
rifle-caliber
Gatling
gun
with
an
electric
motor,
a
relatively
new
invention
at
the
time.
Even
after
Gatling
slowed
down
the
mechanism,
the
new
electric-powered
Gatling
gun
had
a
theoretical
rate
of
fire
of
3,000
rounds
per
minute,
roughly
three
times
the
rate
of
a
typical
modern,
single-barreled
machine
gun.
Gatling's
electric-powered
design
received
U.S.
Patent
#502,185
on
July
25,
1893.[1]
Despite
Gatling's
improvements,
the
Gatling
gun
fell
into
disuse
after
cheaper,
lighter-weight,
recoil
and
gas
operated
machine
guns
were
invented;
Gatling
himself
went
bankrupt
for
a
period.[2]
During
World
War
I,
several
German
companies
were
working
on
externally
powered
guns
for
use
in
aircraft.
Of
those,
the
best-known
today
is
perhaps
the
Fokker-Leimberger,
an
externally
powered
12-barrel
rotary
gun
using
the
7.92x57mm
Mauser
round;
it
was
claimed
to
be
capable
of
firing
over
7,000
rpm,
but
suffered
from
frequent
cartridge-case
ruptures[3]
due
to
its
"nutcracker",
rotary
split-breech
design,
which
is
fairly
different
from
that
of
a
Gatling.[4]
None
of
these
German
guns
went
into
production
during
the
war,
although
a
competing
Siemens
prototype
(possibly
using
a
different
action)
which
was
tried
on
the
Western
Front
scored
a
victory
in
aerial
combat.[3]
The
British
also
experimented
with
this
type
of
split-breech
during
the
1950s,
but
they
were
also
unsuccessful.[5]
Minigun:
1960s–Vietnam[edit]
In
the
1960s,
the
United
States
Armed
Forces
began
exploring
modern
variants
of
the
electric-powered,
rotating
barrel
Gatling-style
weapons
for
use
in
the
Vietnam
War.
American
forces
in
the
Vietnam
War,
which
used
helicopters
as
one
of
the
primary
means
of
transporting
soldiers
and
equipment
through
the
dense
jungle,
found
that
the
thin-skinned
helicopters
were
very
vulnerable
to
small
arms
fire
and
rocket-propelled
grenade
(RPG)
attacks
when
they
slowed
down
to
land.
Although
helicopters
had
mounted
single-barrel
machine
guns,
using
them
to
repel
attackers
hidden
in
the
dense
jungle
foliage
often
led
to
barrels
overheating
or
cartridge
jams.[citation

War.
In
order
to
develop
a
weapon
with
a
more
reliable,
higher
rate
of
fire,
General
Electric
designers
scaled
down
the
rotating-barrel
20
mm
M61
Vulcan
cannon
for
7.62×51
mm
NATO
ammunition.
The
resulting
weapon,
designated
M134
and
known
popularly
as
the
Minigun,
could
fire
up
to
4,000
rounds
per
minute
without
overheating.
The
gun
was
originally
specified
to
fire
at
6,000
rpm,
but
this
was
later
lowered
to
4,000
rpm.
The
Minigun
was
mounted
on
Hughes
OH-6
Cayuse
and
Bell
OH-58
Kiowa
side
pods;
in
the
turret
and
on
pylon
pods
of
Bell
AH-1
Cobra
attack
helicopters;
and
on
door,
pylon
and
pod
mounts
on
Bell
UH-1
Iroquois
transport
helicopters.[citation

Several
larger
aircraft
were
outfitted
with
miniguns
specifically
for
close
air
support:
the
Cessna
A-37
Dragonfly
with
an
internal
gun
and
with
pods
on
wing
hardpoints;
and
the
Douglas
A-1
Skyraider,
also
with
pods
on
wing
hardpoints.
Other
famous

were

Dillon
Aero
minigun[edit]
The
U.S.
government
had
procured
some
10,000
miniguns
during
the
Vietnam
War.
By
1975,
production
of
spare
parts
had
ceased
with
the
Army
in
possession
of
a
large
inventory.
By
1985,
there
were
few
spares
left
in
the
inventory.
Units
that
received
miniguns
could
not
maintain
them,
so
by
the
1990s
only
Task
Force
160
(later
named
the
160th
Special
Operations
Aviation
Regiment
(Airborne)
or
160th
SOAR)
and
some
Navy
Special
Boat
Units
kept
them
in
regular
use.
Around
1995,
the
160th
SOAR
began
acquiring
spare
miniguns.
Industry
had
a
difficult
time
reproducing
parts
according
to
the
original
blueprints,
so
models
that
were
being
procured
were
mechanically
unreliable
and
mixed
with
the
inventory
of
working
spares.
This
resulted
in
using
a
mixed
batch
of
working
and
unreliable
weapons.
This
fact
was
unknown
to
the
160th
SOAR,
and
the
use
of
miniguns
that
would
not
work
shook
the
unit's
confidence
in
the
system.
The
160th
was
on
the
verge
of
dropping
the
Minigun
from
its
inventory
entirely,
which
would
essentially
have
ended
its
service
life
in
the
U.S.
military.[6]
Around
1990,
Dillon
Aero
acquired
a
large
number
of
miniguns
and
spares
from
"a
foreign
user".
The
guns
kept
failing
to
shoot
continuously,
revealing
that
they
were
actually
worn-out
weapons.
The
company
decided
to
fix
the
problems
encountered,
rather
than
simply
putting
the
guns
into
storage.
Fixing
failure
problems
ended
up
improving
the
minigun's
overall
design.[6]
Dillon's
efforts
to
improve
the
minigun
reached
the
160th
SOAR,
and
Dillon
was
invited
to
Fort
Campbell,
Kentucky
to
demonstrate
its
products.
A
delinker–used
to
separate
cartridges
from
ammunition
belts
and
feed
them
into
the
gun
housing–;
and
other
parts
were
tested
on
Campbell's
ranges.
The
160th
SOAR
liked
the
delinker's
performance
and
began
ordering
them
by
1997.
This
prompted
Dillon
to
improve
other
design
aspects,
including
the
bolt,
housing
and
barrel.
Between
1997
and
2001,
Dillon
Aero
was
producing
25–30
products
a
year.
In
2001,
it
was
working
on
a
new
bolt
design
that
increased
performance
and
service
life.
By
2002
virtually
every
component
of
the
minigun
had
been
improved,
so
Dillon
began
producing
complete
weapons
with
improved
components.
The
guns
were
purchased
quickly
by
the
160th
SOAR
as
its
standardized
weapon
system.
The
gun
then
went
through
the
Army's
formal
procurement
system
approval
process
and
in
2003
the
Dillon
Aero
minigun
was
certified
and
designated
M134D.[6]
The
core
of
the
M134D
was
a
steel
housing
and
steel
rotor.
To
focus
on
weight
reduction,
a
titanium
housing
and
rotor
were
introduced,
creating
the
M134D-T.
This
reduced
weight
from
62
pounds
(28
kg)
to
41
pounds
(19
kg).
The
gun
housing
had
a
500,000
round
lifespan
before
it
wore
out,
which
was
higher
than
a
conventional
machine
gun's
40,000
round
lifespan
but
was
a
reduced
time
for
a
rotary
gun.
A
hybrid
of
the
two
weapons
resulted
in
the
M134D-H,
which
had
a
steel
housing
and
titanium
rotor.
It
was
cheaper
with
the
steel
component,
was
only
one
pound
(450
grams)
heavier
than
the
M134D-T,
and
had
an
increased
lifespan
of
1
million
rounds.[7]
The
M134D-H
is
currently
in
use
on
various
160th
Regiment
platforms.[6]
Dillon
also
created
specialized
mounts
and
ammunition-handling
systems.
Initially,
mounts
were
only
made
for
aviation
systems.
Then
from
2003
to
2005,
the
Navy
began
mounting
Dillon
miniguns
on
specialized
small
boats.
In
2005,
the
Naval
Surface
Warfare
Center
Crane
Division
procured
guns
to
mount
on
Humvees.
In
Iraq,
US
Army
Special
Forces
units
on
the
ground
were
frequently
engaged
by
opposition
forces,
so
they
mounted
M134D
miniguns
on
their
vehicles
for
additional
firepower.
After
several
engagements
the
attackers
seemed
to
avoid
vehicles
with
miniguns.
Later
the
Special
Forces
units
began
concealing
their
weapons
so
opposition
troops
would
not
know
which
weapon
they
were
facing.[6]

(October
2013)
Garwood
Industries
created
the
M134G
version
with
several
upgrades
to
the
original
GE
system.
After
extensive
research,
they
determined
that
the
Minigun's
highest
rate
of
fire
may
not
be
the
optimum
rate
of
fire
for
hit
potential.
After
several
extended
firing
exercises,
Garwood
concluded
that
the
optimum
rate
of
fire
for
the
Minigun
system
is
approximately
3,200
rounds
per
minute
(rpm).
This
rate
provides
the
operator
with
the
maximum
amount
of
target
saturation
while
expending
a
minimum
amount
of
ammunition.
The
M134G
is
being
produced
and
offered
with
this
firing
rate
as
well
as
4,000
rpm
and
the
previous
standard
3,000
rpm
rate.[8]
Garwood
Industries
has
implemented
several
other
upgrades
and
improvements
from
the
1960s
Minigun.
The
M134G
system
is
being
manufactured
to
military
requirements
such
that
all
its
components
adhere
to
ISO
standards
to
ensure
quality
traceability.[8]
The
upgrades
include
the
following:
Drive
Motor
–
Many
positive
improvements
to
the
tried
and
true
General
Electric
drive
motor
have
been
implemented
using
products
not
previously
available.
The
new
motor
is
lighter
and
also
has
an
extended
service
life.
Three
proactive
upgrades
have
been
completed
and
the
solenoid
has
been
revised
several
times.[9]
Gun
Control
Unit
–
Garwood
has
upgraded
the
gun
control
unit
using
state-of-the-art
electronics
to
guarantee
unsurpassed
reliability.
A
manual
override
for
the
booster
assembly
is
standard
on
all
M134G
models.[10]
Feeder/Delinker
–
The
Garwood
feeder/delinker
has
an
upgraded
cartridge
handoff
system
and
has
been
finished
with
a
new
high-performance
coating
that
will
increase
longevity
and
enhance
operation
in
all
environments.[11]
Barrel
Clutch
Assembly
–
The
barrel
clutch
assembly
has
been
re-engineered
to
both
lighten
the
weapon
system
and
improve
performance.
The
newly
designed
flash
suppressor
completely
eliminates
the
blinding
flash
that
was
a
constant
problem
with
older
Minigun
versions.
New
designs
are
being
tested
to
even
inhibit
the
sparks
that
are
created
from
unburned
powder
and
it
is
expected
to
completely
eliminate
the
visual
signature
under
fire.[citation
needed]
Bolts
–
A
new
government
model
is
being
finalized
that
utilizes
a
new
proprietary
bolt
design.
The
material
and
coatings
used
in
this
latest
system
greatly
improve
the
longevity
of
the
system
and
exceed
current
specifications.[12]
Grip
Assembly
–
The
M134G
spade
grip
assembly
is
integral
with
the
receiver
through
a
new
proprietary
mounting
lug.
Previous
versions
only
mounted
to
the
clutch
or
other
components.
The
new
mounting
area
greatly
improves
the
rigidity
of
the
system.[13]
Rail
System
–
The
M134G
incorporates
a
rail
system
that
allows
the
easy
mounting
of
several
accessories
that
may
be
found
useful
to
its
operator.
These
include,
but
are
not
limited
to,
scopes,
electronic
sights,
lasers
and
spot
lights.[8]
Design
and
variants[edit]
A
Royal
Navy
minigun,
separated
from
mounting
and
ammunition
The
basic
minigun
is
a
six-barrel,
air-cooled,
and
electrically
driven
rotary
machine
gun.
The
electric
drive
rotates
the
weapon
within
its
housing,
with
a
rotating
firing
pin
assembly
and
rotary
chamber.[14]
The
minigun's
multi-barrel
design
helps
prevent
overheating,
but
also
serves
other
functions.
Multiple
barrels
allow
for
a
greater
capacity
for
a
high
firing
rate,
since
the
serial
process
of
firing/extraction/loading
is
taking
place
in
all
barrels
simultaneously.
Thus,
as
one
barrel
fires,
two
others
are
in
different
stages
of
shell
extraction
and
another
three
are
being
loaded.
The
minigun
is
composed
of
multiple
closed-bolt
rifle
barrels
arranged
in
a
circular
housing.
The
barrels
are
rotated
by
an
external
power
source,
usually
electric,
pneumatic,
or
hydraulic.
Other
rotating-barrel
cannons
are
powered
by
the
gas
pressure
or
recoil
energy
of
fired
cartridges.
A
gas-operated
variant,
designated
XM133,
was
also
developed.[15]
It
is
near
identical
but
has
barrels
with
ports
that
align
with
the
piston
drive
in
the
center
of
the
barrel
cluster.
It
fired
over
3000
rpm
but
was
not
put
into
production.[citation
needed]
While
the
weapon
can
feed
from
linked
ammunition,
it
requires
a
delinking
feeder
to
strip
the
links
as
the
rounds
are
introduced
to
the
chambers.
The
original
feeder
unit
was
designated
MAU-56/A,
but
has
since
been
replaced
by
an
improved
MAU-201/A
unit.[16]

The
General
Electric
minigun
is
in
use
in
several
branches
of
the
U.S.
military,
under
a
number
of
designations.
The
basic
fixed
armament
version
was
given
the
designation
M134
by
the
United
States
Army,
while
the
same
weapon
was
designated
GAU-2/A
(on
a
fixed
mount)
and
GAU-17/A
(flexible
mount)
by
the
United
States
Air
Force
(USAF)
and
United
States
Navy
(USN).
The
USAF
minigun
variant
has
three
versions,
while
the
US
Army
weapon
appears
to
have
incorporated
several
improvements
without
a
change
in
designation.
The
M134D
is
an
improved
version
of
the
M134
designed
and
manufactured
by
Dillon
Aero,[17]
while
Garwood
Industries
manufactures
the
M134G
variant.[18]
Available
sources
show
a
relation
between
both
M134
and
GAU-2/A
and
M134
and
GAU-2B/A.[19][20]
A
separate
variant,
designated
XM196,
with
an
added
ejection
sprocket
was
developed
specifically
for
the
XM53
Armament
Subsystem
on
the
Lockheed
AH-56
Cheyenne
helicopter.[21]
Another
variant
was
developed
by
the
USAF
specifically
for
flexible
installations,
beginning
primarily
with
the
Bell
UH-1N
Twin
Huey
helicopter,
as
the
GAU-17/A.
Produced
by
General
Dynamics,
this
version
has
a
slotted
flash
hider.
The
primary
end
users
of
the
GAU-17/A
have
been
the
USN
and
the
United
States
Marine
Corps
(USMC),
which
mount
the
gun
as
defensive
armament
on
a
number
of
helicopters
and
surface
ships.

systems
were
installed
in
30
days.[22]
The
GAU-17/A
is
designated
Mk
44
in
the
machine
gun
series[22]
and
is
generally
known
as
the
Mk
44
when
installed
on
British
warships.
The
weapon
is
part
of
both
the
A/A49E-11
armament
system
on
the
UH-1N;
and
of
the
A/A49E-13
armament
subsystem
on
the
USAF
Sikorsky
HH-60H
Pave
Hawk
helicopter.
The
weapons
on
these
systems
feature
a
selectable
fire
rate
of
either
2,000
or
4,000
rpm.

pods
and

Armament
Subsystems
One
of
the
first
applications
of
the
weapon
was
in
aircraft
armament
pods.
These
gun
pods
were
used
by
a
wide
variety
of
fixed
and
rotary
wing
aircraft
mainly
during
the
Vietnam
War,
remaining
in
inventory
for
a
period
afterward.
The
standard
pod,
designated
SUU-11/A
by
the
Air
Force
and
M18
by
the
U.S.
Army,
was
a
relatively
simple
unit,
completely
self-contained,
with
a
1,500-round
magazine
directly
feeding
delinked
ammunition
into
the
weapon.
This
means
the
Minigun
fitted
to
the
pod
does
not
require
the
standard
MAU-56/A
delinking
feeder
unit.[25]
A
number
of
variations
of
this
pod
exist.
Artillery
is
a
class
of
large
military
weapons
built
to
fire
munitions
far
beyond
the
range
and
power
of
infantry's
small
arms.
Early
artillery
development
focused
on
the
ability
to
breach
fortifications,
and
led
to
heavy,
fairly
immobile
siege
engines.
As
technology
improved,
lighter,
more
mobile
field
artillery
developed
for
battlefield
use.
This
development
continues
today;
modern
self-propelled
artillery
vehicles
are
highly
mobile
weapons
of
great
versatility
providing
the
largest
share
of
an
army's
total
firepower.
In
its
earliest
sense,
the
word
artillery
referred
to
any
group
of
soldiers
primarily
armed
with
some
form
of
manufactured
weapon
or
armour.
Since
the
introduction
of
gunpowder
and
cannon,
the
word
"artillery"
has
largely
meant
cannon,
and
in
contemporary
usage,
it
usually
refers
to
shell-firing
guns,
howitzers,
mortars,
rockets
and
guided
missiles.
In
common
speech,
the
word
artillery
is
often
used
to
refer
to
individual
devices,
along
with
their
accessories
and
fittings,
although
these
assemblages
are
more
properly
called
"equipments".
However,
there
is
no
generally
recognised
generic
term
for
a
gun,
howitzer,
mortar,
and
so
forth:
the
United
States
uses
"artillery
piece",
but
most
English-speaking
armies
use
"gun"
and
"mortar".
The
projectiles
fired
are
typically
either
"shot"
(if
solid)
or
"shell"
(if
not).
"Shell"
is
a
widely
used
generic
term
for
a
projectile,
which
is
a
component
of
munitions.
By
association,
artillery
may
also
refer
to
the
arm
of
service
that
customarily
operates
such
engines.
In
some
armies
one
arm
has
operated
field,
coast,
anti-aircraft
artillery
and
some
anti-tank
artillery,
in
others
these
have
been
separate
arms
and
in
some
nations
coast
has
been
a
naval
or
marine
responsibility.
In
the
20th
Century
technology
based
target
acquisition
devices,
such
as
radar,
and
systems,
such
as
sound
ranging
and
flash
spotting,
emerged
to
acquire
targets,
primarily
for
artillery.
These
are
usually
operated
by
one
or
more
of
the
artillery
arms.
The
widespread
adoption
of
indirect
fire
in
the
early
20th
Century
introduced
the
need
for
specialist
data
for
field
artillery,
notably
survey
and
meteorological,
in
some
armies
provision
of
these
are
the
responsibility
of
the
artillery
arm.
Artillery
originated
for
use
against
ground
targets—against
infantry,
cavalry
and
other
artillery.
An
early
specialist
development
was
coast
artillery
for
use
against
enemy
ships.
The
early
20th
Century
saw
the
development
of
a
new
class
of
artillery
for
use
against
aircraft.
Artillery
is
arguably
the
most
lethal
form
of
land-based
armament
currently
employed,
and
has
been
since
at
least
the
early
Industrial
Revolution.
The
majority
of
combat
deaths
in
the
Napoleonic
Wars,
World
War
I,
and

on
a
Moncrieff
disappearing
mount,
at
Scaur
Hill
Fort,
Bermuda.
This
is
a
part
of
a
fixed
battery,
meant
to
protect
against
over-land
attack
and
to
serve
as
coastal
artillery.
Although
not
called
as
such,
machines
performing
the
role
recognizable
as
artillery
have
been
employed
in
warfare
since
antiquity.
The
first
references
in
the
western
historical
tradition
begin
at
Syracuse
in
399
BC,
and
these
devices
were
widely
employed
by
the
Roman
legions
in
Republican
times
well
before
the
Christian
era.
Until
the
introduction
of
gunpowder
into
western
warfare,
artillery
depended
upon
mechanical
energy
to
operate,
and
this
severely
limited
the
kinetic
energy
of
the
projectiles,
while
also
requiring
the
construction
of
very
large
apparatus
to
store
sufficient
energy.
For
comparison,
a
Roman
1st-century
BC
catapult
using
stones
of
6.55
kg
fired
with
a
kinetic
energy
of
16,000
joules,
while
a
mid-19th-century
12-pounder
gun
firing
projectiles
of
4.1
kg
fired
the
projectile
with
a
kinetic
energy
of
240,000
joules.
From
the
Middle
Ages
through
most
of
the
modern
era,
artillery
pieces
on
land
were
moved
by
horse-drawn
gun
carriages.
In
the
contemporary
era,
the
artillery
and
crew
rely
on
wheeled
or
tracked
vehicles
as
transportation,
though
some
of
the
largest
were
railway
guns.
Artillery
used
by
naval
forces
has
changed
significantly
also,
with
missiles
replacing
guns
in
surface
warfare.
Over
the
course
of
military
history,
projectiles
were
manufactured
from
a
wide
variety
of
materials,
made
in
a
wide
variety
of
shapes,
and
used
different
means
of
inflicting
physical
damage
and
casualties
to
defeat
specific
types
of
targets.
The
engineering
designs
of
the
means
of
delivery
have
likewise
changed
significantly
over
time,
and
have
become
some
of
the
most
complex
technological
application
today.
In
some
armies,
the
weapon
of
artillery
is
the
projectile,
not
the
equipment
that
fires
it.
The
process
of
delivering
fire
onto
the
target
is
called
gunnery.
The
actions
involved
in
operating
the
piece
are
collectively
called
"serving
the
gun"
by
the
"detachment"
or
gun
crew,
constituting
either
direct
or
indirect
artillery
fire.
The
manner
in
which
artillery
units
or
formations
are
employed
is
called
artillery
support,
and
may
at
different
periods
in
history
refer
to
weapons
designed
to
be
fired
from
ground-,
sea-,
and
even
air-based
weapons
platforms.
Crew[edit]
The
term
"gunner"
is
used
in
some
armed
forces
for
the
soldiers
and
sailors
with
the
primary
function
of
using
artillery.

The
gunners
and
their
guns
are
usually
grouped
in
teams
called
either
"crews"
or
"detachments".
Several
such
crews
and
teams
with
other
functions
are
combined
into
a
unit
of
artillery,
usually
called
a
battery,
although
sometimes
called
a
company.
In
gun
detachments,
each
role
is
numbered,
starting
with
"1"
the
Detachment
Commander,
and
the
highest
number
being
the
Coverer,
the
second-in-command.
"Gunner"
is
also
the
lowest
rank
and
junior
non-commissioned
officers
are
"Bombardiers"
in
some
artillery
arms.
Batteries
are
roughly
equivalent
to
a
company
in
the
infantry,
and
are
combined
into
larger
military
organizations
for
administrative
and
operational
purposes,
either
battalions
or
regiments,
depending
on
the
army.
These
may
be
grouped
into
brigades;
the
Russian
army
also
groups
some
brigades
into
artillery
divisions,
and
the
People's
Liberation
Army
has
artillery
corps.
The
term
"artillery"
is
also
applied
to
a
combat
arm
of
most
military
services
when
used
organizationally
to
describe
units
and
formations
of
the
national
armed
forces
that
operate
the
weapons.
During
military
operations,
the
role
of
field
artillery
is
to
provide
support
to
other
arms
in
combat
or
to
attack
targets,
particularly
in
depth.
Broadly,
these
effects
fall
into
two
categories,
either
to
suppress
or
neutralize
the
enemy,
or
to
cause
casualties,
damage,
and
destruction.
This
is
mostly
achieved
by
delivering
high-explosive
munitions
to
suppress,
or
inflict
casualties
on
the
enemy
from
casing
fragments
and
other
debris
and
blast,
or
by
destroying
enemy
positions,
equipment,
and
vehicles.
Non-lethal
munitions,
notably
smoke,
can
also
be
used
to
suppress
or
neutralize
the
enemy
by
obscuring
their
view.
Fire
may
be
directed
by
an
artillery
observer
or
other
observer,
including
manned
and
unmanned
aircraft
pilots,
or
called
onto
map
coordinates.
Military
doctrine
has
played
a
significant
influence
on
the
core
engineering
design
considerations
of
artillery
ordnance
through
its
history,
in
seeking
to
achieve
a
balance
between
delivered
volume
of
fire
with
ordnance
mobility.
However,
during
the
modern
period,
the
consideration
of
protecting
the
gunners
also
arose
due
to
the
late-19th-century
introduction
of
the
new
generation
of
infantry
weapons
using
conoidal
bullet,
better
known
as
the
Minié
ball,
with
a
range
almost
as
long
as
that
of
field
artillery.
The
gunners'
increasing
proximity
to
and
participation
in
direct
combat
against
other
combat
arms
and
attacks
by
aircraft
made
the
introduction
of
a
gun
shield
necessary.
The
problems
of
how
to
employ
a
fixed
or
horse-towed
gun
in
mobile
warfare
necessitated
the
development
of
new
methods
of
transporting
the
artillery
into
combat.
Two
distinct
forms
of
artillery
developed:
the
towed
gun,
which
was
used
primarily
to
attack
or
defend
a
fixed
line;
and
the
self-propelled
gun,
which
was
designed
to
accompany
a
mobile
force
and
provide
continuous
fire
support.
These
influences
have
guided
the
development
of
artillery
ordnance,
systems,
organisations,
and
operations
until
the
present,
with
artillery
systems
capable
of
providing
support
at
ranges
from
as
little
as
100
m
to
the
intercontinental
ranges
of
ballistic
missiles.
The
only
combat
in
which
artillery
is
unable
to
take
part
in
is
close
quarters
combat,
with
the
possible
exception
of
artillery
reconnaissance
teams.[2]
Etymology[edit]
The
word
as
used
in
the
current
context
originated
in
the
Middle
Ages.
One
suggestion
is
that
it
comes
from
the
Old
French
atellier,
meaning
"to
arrange",
and
attillement,
meaning
"equipment".
From
the
13th
century,
an
artillier
referred
to
a
builder
of
any
war
equipment;
and,
for
the
next
250
years,
the
sense
of
the
word
"artillery"
covered
all
forms
of
military
weapons.
Hence,
the
naming
of
the
Honourable
Artillery
Company
an
essentially
infantry
unit
until
the
19th
century.
Another
suggestion
is
that
it
comes
from
the
Italian
arte
de
tirare
(art
of
shooting),
coined
by
one
of
the
first
theorists
on
the
use
of
artillery,
Niccolò
Tartaglia.

Gunpowder
artillery
in
the
Song
dynasty
The
first
documented
record
of
artillery
with
gunpowder
propellant
used
on
the
battlefield
was
on
January
28,
1132,
when
General
Han
Shizhong
of
the
Song
dynasty
used
escalade
and
Huochong
to
capture
a
city
in
Fujian.[5]
Early
Chinese
artillery
had
vase-like
shapes.
This
includes
the
"long
range
awe
inspiring"
cannon
dated
from
1350
and
found
in
the
14th
century
Ming
Dynasty
treatise
Huolongjing.[4]
With
the
development
of
better
metallurgy
techniques,
later
cannons
abandoned
the
vase
shape
of
early
Chinese
artillery.
This
change
can
be
seen
in
the
bronze
"thousand
ball
thunder
cannon,"
an
early
example
of
field
artillery.[6]
These
small,
crude
weapons
diffused
into
the
Middle
East
(the
madfaa,
see
also
the
German
Wikipedia
and
midfa)
and
reached
Europe
in
the
13th
century,
in
a
very
limited
manner.
In
Asia,
Mongols
adopted
the
Chinese
artillery
and
used
it
effectively
in
the
great
conquest.
By
the
late
14th
century,
Chinese
rebels
used
organized
artillery
and
cavalry
to
push
Mongols
out.
As
small
smooth-bore
tubes
these
were
initially
cast
in
iron
or
bronze
around
a
core,
with
the
first
drilled
bore
ordnance
recorded
in
operation
near
Seville
in
1247.[citation

They
fired
lead,
iron,
or
stone
balls,
sometimes
large
arrows
and
on
occasions
simply
handfuls
of
whatever
scrap
came
to
hand.
During
the
Hundred
Years'
War,
these
weapons
became
more
common,
initially
as
the
bombard
and
later
the
cannon.
Cannon
were
always
muzzle-loaders.
While
there
were
many
early
attempts
at
breech-loading
designs,
a
lack
of
engineering
knowledge
rendered
these
even
more
dangerous
to
use
than
muzzle-loaders.

In
1415,
the
Portuguese
invaded
the
Mediterranean
port
town
of
Ceuta.
While
it
is
difficult
to
confirm
the
use
of
firearms
in
the
siege
of
the
city,
it
is
known
the
Portuguese
defended
it
thereafter
with
firearms,
namely
bombardas,
colebratas,
and
falconetes.
In
1419,
Sultan
Abu
Sa'id
led
an
army
to
reconquer
the
fallen
city,
and
Moroccans
brought
cannons
and
used
them
in
the
assault
on
Ceuta.
Finally,
hand-held
firearms
and
riflemen
appear
in
Morocco,
in
1437,
in
an
expedition
against
the
people
of
Tangiers.[9][page
needed]
It
is
clear
these
weapons
had
developed
into
several
different
forms,
from
small
guns
to
large
artillery
pieces.
The
artillery
revolution
in
Europe
caught
on
during
the
Hundred
Years'
War
and
changed
the
way
that
battles
were
fought.
In
the
preceding
decades,
the
English
had
even
used
a
gunpowder-like
weapon
in
military
campaigns
against
the
Scottish.[10]
However,
at
this
time,
the
cannons
used
in
battle
were
very
small
and
not
particularly
powerful.
Cannons
were
only
useful
for
the
defense
of
a
castle,
as
demonstrated
at
Breteuil
in
1356,
when
the
besieged
English
used
a
cannon
to
destroy
an
attacking
French
assault
tower.
By
the
end
of
the
14th
century,
cannon
were
only
powerful
enough
to
knock
in
roofs,
and
could
not
penetrate
castle
walls.
However,
a
major
change
occurred
between
1420
and
1430,
when
artillery
became
much
more
powerful
and
could
now
batter
strongholds
and
fortresses
quite
efficiently.
The
English,
French,
and
Burgundians
all
advanced
in
military
technology,
and
as
a
result
the
traditional
advantage
that
went
to
the
defense
in
a
siege
was
lost.
The
cannon
during
this
period
were
elongated,
and
the
recipe
for
gunpowder
was
improved
to
make
it
three
times
as
powerful
as
before.[11]
These
changes
led
to
the
increased
power
in
the
artillery
weapons
of
the
time.
The
Austrian
Pumhart
von
Steyr,
the
earliest
extant
supergun.[12]
Joan
of
Arc
encountered
gunpowder
weaponry
several
times.
When
she
led
the
French
against
the
English
at
the
Battle
of
Tourelles,
in
1430,
she
faced
heavy
gunpowder
fortifications,
and
yet
her
troops
prevailed
in
that
battle.
In
addition,
she
led
assaults
against
the
English-held
towns
of
Jargeau,
Meung,
and
Beaugency,
all
with
the
support
of
large
artillery
units.
When
she
led
the
assault
on
Paris,
Joan
faced
stiff
artillery
fire,
especially
from
the
suburb
of
St.
Denis,
which
ultimately
led
to
her
defeat
in
this
battle.
In
April
1430,
she
went
to
battle
against
the
Burgundians,
whose
support
was
purchased
by
the
English.
At
this
time,
the
Burgundians
had
the
strongest
and
largest
gunpowder
arsenal
among
the
European
powers,
and
yet
the
French,
under
Joan
of
Arc's
leadership,
were
able
to
beat
back
the
Burgundians
and
defend
themselves.[13]
As
a
result,
most
of
the
battles
of
the
Hundred
Years'
War
that
Joan
of
Arc
participated
in
were
fought
with
gunpowder
artillery.
The
army
of
Mehmet
the
Conqueror,
which
conquered
Constantinople
in
1453,
included
both
artillery
and
foot
soldiers
armed
with
gunpowder
weapons.[14]
The
Ottomans
brought
to
the
siege
sixty-nine
guns
in
fifteen
separate
batteries
and
trained
them
at
the
walls
of
the
city.
The
barrage
of
Ottoman
cannon
fire
lasted
forty
days,
and
they
are
estimated
to
have
fired
19,320
times.[15]
Artillery
also
played
a
decisive
role
in
the
Battle
of

of
1444.

were
developed.

and

about
200,000
Korean
and
Chinese
troops

fought
against
Japan
in
Korea
actively
used

artillery

The
reduction
in
the
size
of
the
barrel
was
due
to
improvements
in
both
iron
technology
and
gunpowder
manufacture,
while
the
development
of
trunnions
–
projections
at
the
side
of
the
cannon
as
an
integral
part
of
the
cast
–
allowed
the
barrel
to
be
fixed
to
a
more
movable
base,
and
also
made
raising
or
lowering
the
barrel
much
easier.[19]

The

is
usually
credited
to
Jan
Žižka,
who
deployed
his
oxen-hauled
cannon
during
the
Hussite
Wars
of
Bohemia
(1418–1424).
However
cannons
were
still
large
and
cumbersome.
With
the
rise
of
musketry
in
the
16th
century,
cannon
were
largely
(though
not
entirely)
displaced
from
the
battlefield—the
cannon
were
too
slow
and
cumbersome
to
be
used
and
too
easily
lost
to
a
rapid
enemy
advance.
The
combining
of
shot
and
powder
into
a
single
unit,
a
cartridge,
occurred
in
the
1620s
with
a
simple
fabric
bag,
and
was
quickly
adopted
by
all
nations.
It
speeded
loading
and
made
it
safer,
but
unexpelled
bag
fragments
were
an
additional
fouling
in
the
gun
barrel
and
a
new
tool—a
worm—was
introduced
to
remove
them.
Gustavus
Adolphus
is
identified
as
the
general
who
made
cannon
an
effective
force
on
the
battlefield—pushing
the
development
of
much
lighter
and
smaller
weapons
and
deploying
them
in
far
greater
numbers
than
previously.
The
outcome
of
battles
was
still
determined
by
the
clash
of
infantry.
Shells,
explosive-filled
fused
projectiles,
were
also
developed
in
the
17th
century.[citation

The
development
of
specialized
pieces—shipboard
artillery,
howitzers
and
mortars—was
also
begun
in
this
period.
More
esoteric
designs,
like
the
multi-barrel
ribauldequin
(known
as
"organ
guns"),
were
also
produced.
The
1650
book
by
Kazimierz
Siemienowicz
Artis
Magnae
Artilleriae
pars
prima[20]
was
one
of
the
most
important
contemporary
publications
on
the
subject
of
artillery.
For
over
two
centuries
this
work
was
used
in
Europe
as
a
basic
artillery
manual.[citation

One
of
the
most
significant
effects
of
artillery
during
this
period
was
however
somewhat
more
indirect
–
by
easily
reducing
to
rubble
any
medieval-type
fortification
or
city
wall
(some
which
had
stood
since
Roman
times),
it
abolished
millennia
of
siege-warfare
strategies
and
styles
of
fortification
building.[19]
This
led,
among
other
things,
to
a
frenzy
of
new
bastion-style
fortifications
to
be
built
all
over
Europe
and
in
its
colonies,
but
also
had
a
strong
integrating
effect
on
emerging
nation-states,
as
kings
were
able
to
use
their
newfound
artillery
superiority
to
force
any
local
dukes
or
lords
to
submit
to
their
will,
setting
the
stage
for
the
absolutist
kingdoms
to
come.[19]
Modern
rocket
artillery
can
trace
its
heritage
back
to
the
Mysorean
rockets
of
India.
Their
first
recorded
use
was
in
1780
during
the
battles
of
the
Second,
Third
and
Fourth
Mysore
Wars.
The
wars
fought
between
the
British
East
India
Company
and
the
Kingdom
of
Mysore
in
India
made
use
of
the
rockets
as
a
weapon.
In
the
Battle
of
Pollilur
(1780),
the
Siege
of
Seringapatam
(1792)
and
in
Battle
of
Seringapatam
in
1799
these
rockets
were
used
with
considerable
effect
against
the
British."[21]
After
the
wars,
several
Mysore
rockets
were
sent
to
England,
and
from
1801,
William
Congreve
copied
the
rockets
with
minor
modifications
as
the
Congreve
rocket
which
were
used
effectively
during
the
Napoleonic
Wars
and
the
War
of
1812.[22]
Napoleonic
artillery[edit]
Cannons
continued
to
become
smaller
and
lighter—Frederick
II
of
Prussia
deployed
the
first
genuine
light
artillery
during
the
Seven
Years'
War.
Jean-Baptiste
de
Gribeauval,
a
French
artillery
engineer,
introduced
the
standardization
of
cannon
design
in
the
mid-18th
century.
He
developed
a
6-inch
(150
mm)
field
howitzer
whose
gun
barrel,
carriage
assembly
and
ammunition
specifications
were
made
uniform
for
all
French
cannons.
The
standardized
interchangeable
parts
of
these
cannons
down
to
the
nuts,
bolts
and
screws
made
their
mass
production
and
repair
much
easier.
Another
major
change
at
this
time
was
the
development
of
a
flintlock
firing
mechanism
for
the
cannons
to
replace
the
old
method
of
igniting
powder
in
the
cannon
touchhole.
The
flintlock
was
a
far
more
reliable
(and
safe)
mechanism.
These
improvements
in
the
French
artillery
were
essential
for
the
later
military
successes
of
Napoleon.
Napoleon,
himself
a
former
artillery
officer,
perfected
the
tactic
of
massed
artillery
batteries
unleashed
upon
a
critical
point
in
his
enemies'
line
as
a
prelude
to
a
decisive
infantry
and
cavalry
assault.
Modern
artillery[edit]

Artillery
in
the
American
Civil
War
Armstrong

by
Japan
during
the
Boshin
war
(1868–69).
The
development
of
modern
artillery
occurred
in
the
mid
to
late
19th
century
as
a
result
of
the
convergence
of
various
improvements
in
the
underlying
technology.
Advances
in
metallurgy
allowed
for
the
construction
of
breech-loading
rifled
guns
that
could
fire
at
a
much
greater
muzzle
velocity.
After
the
British
artillery
was
shown
up
in
the
Crimean
War
as
having
barely
changed
since
the
Napoleonic
Wars
the
industrialist
William
Armstrong
was
awarded
a
contract
by
the
government
to
design
a
new
piece
of
artillery.
Production
started
in
1855
at
the
Elswick
Ordnance
Company
and
the
Royal
Arsenal
at
Woolwich,
and
the
outcome
was
the
revolutionary
Armstrong
Gun,
which
marked
the
birth
of
modern
artillery.[23][24]
Three
of
its
features
particularly
stand
out.
First,
the
piece
was
rifled,
which
allowed
for
a
much
more
accurate
and
powerful
action.
Although
rifling
had
been
tried
on
small
arms
since
the
15th
century,
the
necessary
machinery
to
accurately
rifle
artillery
was
only
available
by
the
mid-19th
century.
Martin
von
Wahrendorff,
and
Joseph
Whitworth
independently
produced
rifled
cannon
in
the
1840s,
but
it
was
Armstrong's
gun
that
was
first
to
see
widespread
use
during
the
Crimean
War.[25]
The
cast
iron
shell
of
the
Armstrong
gun
was
similar
in
shape
to
a
Minié
ball
and
had
a
thin
lead
coating
which
made
it
fractionally
larger
than
the
gun's
bore
and
which
engaged
with
the
gun's
rifling
grooves
to
impart
spin
to
the
shell.
This
spin,
together
with
the
elimination
of
windage
as
a
result
of
the
tight
fit,
enabled
the
gun
to
achieve
greater
range
and
accuracy
than
existing
smooth-bore
muzzle-loaders
with
a
smaller
powder
charge.
8-inch
Armstrong
gun
during
American
Civil
War,
Fort
Fisher,
1865.
His
gun
was
also
a
breech-loader.
Although
attempts
at
breech-loading
mechanisms
had
been
made
since
medieval
times,
the
essential
engineering
problem
was
that
the
mechanism
couldn't
withstand
the
explosive
charge.
It
was
only
with
the
advances
in
metallurgy
and
precision
engineering
capabilities
during
the
Industrial
Revolution
that
Armstrong
was
able
to
construct
a
viable
solution.
The
gun
combined
all
the
properties
that
make
up
an
effective
artillery
piece.
The
gun
was
mounted
on
a
carriage
in
such
a
way
as
to
return
the
gun
to
firing
position
after
the
recoil.
What
made
the
gun
really
revolutionary
lay
in
the
technique
of
the
construction
of
the
gun
barrel
that
allowed
it
to
withstand
much
more
powerful
explosive
forces.
The
"built-up"
method
involved
assembling
the
barrel
with
wrought-iron
(later
mild
steel
was
used)
tubes
of
successively
smaller
diameter.[26]
The
tube
would
then
be
heated
to
allow
it
to
expand
and
fit
over
the
previous
tube.
When
it
cooled
the
gun
would
contract
although
not
back
to
its
original
size,
which
allowed
an
even
pressure
along
the
walls
of
the
gun
which
was
directed
inward
against
the
outward
forces
that
the
gun
firing
exerted
on
the
barrel.[27]
Another
innovative
feature,
more
usually
associated
with
20th-century
guns,
was
what
Armstrong
called
its
"grip",
which
was
essentially
a
squeeze
bore;
the
6
inches
of
the
bore
at
the
muzzle
end
was
of
slightly
smaller
diameter,
which
centered
the
shell
before
it
left
the
barrel
and
at
the
same
time
slightly
swaged
down
its
lead
coating,
reducing
its
diameter
and
slightly
improving
its
ballistic
qualities.
The
French
Canon
de
75
modèle
1897,
the
first
modern
artillery
piece.
Armstrong's
system
was
adopted
in
1858,
initially
for
"special
service
in
the
field"
and
initially
he
only
produced
smaller
artillery
pieces,
6-pounder
(2.5
in/64
mm)
mountain
or
light
field
guns,
9-pounder
(3
in/76
mm)
guns
for
horse
artillery,
and
12-pounder
(3
inches
/76
mm)
field
guns.
The
first
cannon
to
contain
all
'modern'
features
is
generally
considered
to
be
the
French
75
of
1897.[28][29]
It
was
the
first
field
gun
to
include
a
hydro-pneumatic
recoil
mechanism,
which
kept
the
gun's
trail
and
wheels
perfectly
still
during
the
firing
sequence.
Since
it
did
not
need
to
be
re-aimed
after
each
shot,
the
crew
could
fire
as
soon
as
the
barrel
returned
to
its
resting
position.
In
typical
use,
the
French
75
could
deliver
fifteen
rounds
per
minute
on
its
target,
either
shrapnel
or
melinite
high-explosive,
up
to
about
5
miles
(8,500
m)
away.
Its
firing
rate
could
even
reach
close
to
30
rounds
per
minute,
albeit
only
for
a
very
short
time
and
with
a
highly
experienced
crew.
These
were
rates
that
contemporary
bolt
action
rifles
could
not
match.
The
gun
used
cased
ammunition,
was
breech-loading,
had
modern
sights,
a
self-contained
firing
mechanism
and
hydro-pneumatic
recoil
dampening.
Indirect
fire[edit]
Main

Indirect

Indirect
fire,
the
firing
of
a
projectile
without
relying
on
direct
line
of
sight
between
the
gun
and
the
target,
possibly
dates
back
to
the
16th
century.[30]
Early
battlefield
use
of
indirect
fire
may
have
occurred
at
Paltzig
in
July
1759,
when
the
Russian
artillery
fired
over
the
tops
of
trees,[31]
and
at
the
Battle
of
Waterloo,
where
a
battery
of
the
Royal
Horse
Artillery
fired
Shrapnel
indirectly
against
advancing
French
troops.[32]
In
1882,
Russian
Lieutenant
Colonel
KG
Guk
published
Indirect
Fire
for
Field
Artillery,
which
provided
a
practical
method
of
using
aiming
points
for
indirect
fire
by
describing,
"all
the
essentials
of
aiming
points,
crest
clearance,
and
corrections
to
fire
by
an
observer".[33]
The
highly
effective
German
15cm
field
howitzers
during
World
War
I
A
few
years
later,
the
Richtfläche
(lining-plane)
sight
was
invented
in
Germany
and
provided
a
means
of
indirect
laying
in
azimuth,
complementing
the
clinometers
for
indirect
laying
in
elevation
which
already
existed.
Despite
conservative
opposition
within
the
German
army,
indirect
fire
was
adopted
as
doctrine
by
the
1890s.
In
the
early
1900s,
Goertz
in
Germany
developed
an
optical
sight
for
azimuth
laying.
It
quickly
replaced
the
lining-plane;
in
English,
it
became
the
'Dial
Sight'
(UK)
or
'Panoramic
Telescope'
(US).
The
British
halfheartedly
experimented
with
indirect
fire
techniques
since
the
1890s,
but
with
the
onset
of
the
Boer
War,
they
were
the
first
to
apply
the
theory
in
practice
in
1899,
although
they
had
to
improvise
without
a
lining-plane
sight.[34]
In
the
next
15
years
leading
up
to
World
War
I,
the
techniques
of
indirect
fire
became
available
for
all
types
of
artillery.
Indirect
fire
was
the
defining
characteristic
of
20th-century
artillery
and
led
to
undreamt
of
changes
in
the
amount
of
artillery,
its
tactics,
organisation,
and
techniques,
most
of
which
occurred
during
World
War
I.
An
implication
of
indirect
fire
and
improving
guns
was
increasing
range
between
gun
and
target,
this
increased
the
time
of
flight
and
the
vertex
of
the
trajectory.
The
result
was
decreasing
accuracy
(the
increasing
distance
between
the
target
and
the
mean
point
of
impact
of
the
shells
aimed
at
it)
caused
by
the
increasing
effects
of
non-standard
conditions.
Indirect
firing
data
was
based
on
standard
conditions
including
a
specific
muzzle
velocity,
zero
wind,
air
temperature
and
density,
and
propellant
temperature.
In
practice,
this
standard
combination
of
conditions
almost
never
existed,
they
varied
throughout
the
day
and
day
to
day,
and
the
greater
the
time
of
flight,
the
greater
the
inaccuracy.
An
added
complication
was
the
need
for
survey
to
accurately
fix
the
coordinates
of
the
gun
position
and
provide
accurate
orientation
for
the
guns.
Of
course,
targets
had
to
be
accurately
located,
but
by
1916,
air
photo
interpretation
techniques
enabled
this,
and
ground
survey
techniques
could
sometimes
be
used.
In
1914,
the
methods
of
correcting
firing
data
for
the
actual
conditions
were
often
convoluted,
and
the
availability
of
data
about
actual
conditions
was
rudimentary
or
non-existent,
the
assumption
was
that
fire
would
always
be
ranged
(adjusted).
British
heavy
artillery
worked
energetically
to
progressively
solve
all
these
problems
from
late
1914
onwards,
and
by
early
1918,
had
effective
processes
in
place
for
both
field
and
heavy
artillery.
These
processes
enabled
'map-shooting',
later
called
'predicted
fire';
it
meant
that
effective
fire
could
be
delivered
against
an
accurately
located
target
without
ranging.
Nevertheless,
the
mean
point
of
impact
was
still
some
tens
of
yards
from
the
target-centre
aiming
point.
It
was
not
precision
fire,
but
it
was
good
enough
for
concentrations
and
barrages.
These
processes
remain
in
use
into
the
21st
Century
with
refinements
to
calculations
enabled
by
computers
and
improved
data
capture
about
non-standard
conditions.
The
British
major-general
Henry
Hugh
Tudor
pioneered
armour
and
artillery
cooperation
at
the
breakthrough
Battle
of
Cambrai.
The
improvements
in
providing
and
using
data
for
non-standard
conditions
(propellant
temperature,
muzzle
velocity,
wind,
air
temperature,
and
barometric
pressure)
were
developed
by
the
major
combatants
throughout
the
war
and
enabled
effective
predicted
fire.[35]
The
effectiveness
of
this
was
demonstrated
by
the
British
in
1917
(at
Cambrai)
and
by
Germany
the
following
year
(Operation
Michael).

at
the
beginning
of
the
20th
century
and
was
greatly
enhanced
by
the
development
of
predicted
fire
methods
in
World
War
I.
However,
indirect
fire
was
area
fire;
it
was
and
is
not
suitable
for
destroying
point
targets;
its
primary
purpose
is
area
suppression.
Nevertheless,
by
the
late
1970s
precision
munitions
started
to
appear,
notably
the
US
155mm
Copperhead
and
its
Soviet
152mm
equivalent
that
had
success
in
Indian
service.
These
relied
on
laser
designation
to
'illuminate'
the
target
that
the
shell
homed
onto.
However,
in
the
early
21st
Century,
the
Global
Positioning
System
(GPS)
enabled
relatively
cheap
and
accurate
guidance
for
shells
and
missiles,
notably
the
US
155mm
Excalibur
and
the
227mm
GMLRS
rocket.
The
introduction
of
these
led
to
a
new
issue,
the
need
for
very
accurate
three
dimensional
target
coordinates
–
the
mensuration
process.
Weapons
covered
by
the
term
'modern
artillery'
include
"cannon"
artillery
(such
as
howitzer,
mortar,
and
field
gun)
and
rocket
artillery.
Certain
smaller-caliber
mortars
are
more
properly
designated
small
arms
rather
than
artillery,
albeit
indirect-fire
small
arms.
This
term
also
came
to
include
coastal
artillery
which
traditionally
defended
coastal
areas
against
seaborne
attack
and
controlled
the
passage
of
ships.
With
the
advent
of
powered
flight
at
the
start
of
the
20th
century,
artillery
also
included
ground-based
anti-aircraft
batteries.
The
term
"artillery"
has
traditionally
not
been
used
for
projectiles
with
internal
guidance
systems,
preferring
the
term
"missilery",[citation
needed]
though
some
modern
artillery
units
employ
surface-to-surface
missiles.
Advances
in
terminal
guidance
systems
for
small
munitions
has
allowed
large-caliber
guided
projectiles
to
be
developed,
blurring
this
distinction.
Ammunition[edit]
Artillery
ammunition
can
also
make
use
of
nuclear
warheads,
as
seen
in
this
1953
nuclear
test.

One
of
the
most
important
roles
of
logistics
is
the
supply
of
munitions
as
a
primary
type
of
artillery
consumable,
their
storage
and
the
provision
of
fuses,
detonators
and
warheads
at
the
point
where
artillery

Fuzes[edit]
Main
article:
Artillery
fuze
Fuzes
are
the
devices
that
initiate
an
artillery
projectile,
either
to
detonate
its
high
explosive
(HE)
filling
or
eject
its
cargo
(illuminating
flare
or
smoke
canisters
being
examples).
The
official
military
spelling
is
"fuze".[38]
Broadly
there
are
four
main
types:
impact
(including
graze
and
delay)
mechanical
time
including
airburst
proximity
sensor
including
airburst
electronic
time
including
airburst
Most
artillery
fuzes
are
nose
fuzes.
However,
base
fuzes
have
been
used
with
armour
piercing
shells
and
for
squash
head
(HESH
or
HEP)
anti-tank
shells.
At
least
one
nuclear
shell
and
its
non-nuclear
spotting
version
also
used
a
multi-deck
mechanical
time
fuze
fitted
into
its
base.
Impact
fuzes
were,
and
in
some
armies
remain,
the
standard
fuze
for
HE
projectiles.
Their
default
action
is
normally
'superquick',
some
have
had
a
'graze'
action
which
allows
them
to
penetrate
light
cover
and
others
have
'delay'.
Delay
fuzes
allow
the
shell
to
penetrate
the
ground
before
exploding.
Armor-
or
concrete-piercing
fuzes
are
specially
hardened.
During
World
War
I
and
later,
ricochet
fire
with
delay
or
graze
fuzed
HE
shells,
fired
with
a
flat
angle
of
descent,
was
used
to
achieve
airburst.
HE
shells
can
be
fitted
with
other
fuzes.
Airburst
fuzes
usually
have
a
combined
airburst
and
impact
function.
However,
until
the
introduction
of
proximity
fuzes,
the
airburst
function
was
mostly
used
with
cargo
munitions—for
example,
shrapnel,
illumination,
and
smoke.
The
larger
calibers
of
anti-aircraft
artillery
are
almost
always
used
airburst.
Airburst
fuzes
have
to
have
the
fuze
length
(running
time)
set
on
them.
This
is
done
just
before
firing
using
either
a
wrench
or
a
fuze
setter
pre-set
to
the
required
fuze
length.
Early
airburst
fuzes
used
igniferous
timers
which
lasted
into
the
second
half
of
the
20th
century.
Mechanical
time
fuzes
appeared
in
the
early
part
of
the
century.
These
required
a
means
of
powering
them.
The
Thiel
mechanism
used
a
spring
and
escapement
(i.e.
'clockwork'),
Junghans
used
centrifugal
force
and
gears,
and
Dixi
used
centrifugal
force
and
balls.
From
about
1980,
electronic
time
fuzes
started
replacing
mechanical
ones
for
use
with
cargo
munitions.
Proximity
fuzes
have
been
of
two
types:
photo-electric
or
radar.
The
former
was
not
very
successful
and
seems
only
to
have
been
used
with
British
anti-aircraft
artillery
'unrotated
projectiles'
(rockets)
in
World
War
II.
Radar
proximity
fuzes
were
a
big
improvement
over
the
mechanical
(time)
fuzes
which
they
replaced.
Mechanical
time
fuzes
required
an
accurate
calculation
of
their
running
time,
which
was
affected
by
non-standard
conditions.
With
HE
(requiring
a
burst
20
to
30
feet
(9.1
m)
above
the
ground),
if
this
was
very
slightly
wrong
the
rounds
would
either
hit
the
ground
or
burst
too
high.
Accurate
running
time
was
less
important
with
cargo
munitions
that
burst
much
higher.
The
first
radar
proximity
fuzes
(codenamed
'VT')
were
initially
used
against
aircraft
in
World
War
II.
Their
ground
use
was
delayed
for
fear
of
the
enemy
recovering
'blinds'
(artillery
shells
which
failed
to
detonate)
and
copying
the
fuze.
The
first
proximity
fuzes
were
designed
to
detonate
about
30
feet
(9.1
m)
above
the
ground.
These
air-bursts
are
much
more
lethal
against
personnel
than
ground
bursts
because
they
deliver
a
greater
proportion
of
useful
fragments
and
deliver
them
into
terrain
where
a
prone
soldier
would
be
protected
from
ground
bursts.
However,
proximity
fuzes
can
suffer
premature
detonation
because
of
the
moisture
in
heavy
rain
clouds.
This
led
to
'controlled
variable
time'
(CVT)
after
World
War
II.
These
fuzes
have
a
mechanical
timer
that
switched
on
the
radar
about
5
seconds
before
expected
impact,
they
also
detonated
on
impact.
The
proximity
fuze
emerged
on
the
battlefields
of
Europe
in
late
December
1944.
They
have
become
known
as
the
U.S.
Artillery's
"Christmas
present",
and
were
much
appreciated
when
they
arrived
during
the
Battle
of
the
Bulge.
They
were
also
used
to
great
effect
in
anti-aircraft
projectiles
in
the
Pacific
against
kamikaze
as
well
as
in
Britain
against
V-1
flying
bombs.[39]
Electronic
multi-function
fuzes
started
to
appear
around
1980.
Using
solid-state
electronics
they
were
relatively
cheap
and
reliable,
and
became
the
standard
fitted
fuze
in
operational
ammunition
stocks
in
some
western
armies.
The
early
versions
were
often
limited
to
proximity
airburst,
albeit
with
height
of
burst
options,
and
impact.
Some
offered
a
go/no-go
functional
test
through
the
fuze
setter.
Later
versions
introduced
induction
fuze
setting
and
testing
instead
of
physically
placing
a
fuze
setter
on
the
fuze.
The
latest,
such
as
Junghan's
DM84U
provide
options
giving,
superquick,
delay,
a
choice
of
proximity
heights
of
burst,
time
and
a
choice
of
foliage
penetration
depths.
A
new
type
of
artillery
fuze
will
appear
soon.
In
addition
to
other
functions
these
offer
some
course
correction
capability,
not
full
precision
but
sufficient
to
significantly
reduce
the
dispersion
of
the
shells
on
the
ground.
Projectiles[edit]
Main
article:
Shell
(projectile)
The
projectile
is
the
munition
or
"bullet"
fired
downrange.
This
may
or
may
not
be
an
explosive
device.
Traditionally,
projectiles
have
been
classified
as
"shot"
or
"shell",
the
former
being
solid
and
the
latter
having
some
form
of
"payload".
Shells
can
also
be
divided
into
three
configurations:
bursting,
base
ejection
or
nose
ejection.
The
latter
is
sometimes
called
the
shrapnel
configuration.
The
most
modern
is
base
ejection,
which
was
introduced
in
World
War
I.
Both
base
and
nose
ejection
are
almost
always
used
with
airburst
fuzes.
Bursting
shells
use
various
types
of
fuze
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
payload
and
the
tactical
need
at
the
time.
Payloads
have
included:
Bursting:
high-explosive,
white
phosphorus
("Willie
Pete"
or
"Wilson
Picket"),[citation
needed]
coloured
marker,
chemical,
nuclear
devices;
high
explosive
anti-tank
(HEAT)
and
canister
may
be
considered
special
types
of
bursting
shell.
Base
Ejection:
dual
purpose
improved
conventional
munitions
(DPICM)-bomblets,
which
arm
themselves
and
function
after
a
set
number
of
rotations
after
having
been
ejected
from
the
projectile
(this
produces
unexploded
sub-munitions,
or
"duds",
which
remain
dangerous),
scatterable
mines,
illuminating,
coloured
flare,
smoke,
incendiary,
propaganda,
chaff[40]
(foil
to
jam
radars:
originally
known
as
"window")[41]
and
modern
exotics
such
as
electronic
payloads
and
sensor-fuzed
munitions.
Nose
Ejection:
shrapnel,
star,
incendiary
and
flechette
(a
more
modern
version
of
shrapnel).
Stabilization[edit]
Rifled
Traditionally,
artillery
projectiles
have
been
spin-stabilised,
meaning
that
they
spin
in
flight
so
that
gyroscopic
forces
prevent
them
from
tumbling.
Spin
is
induced
by
gun
barrels
having
rifling
which
engages
a
soft
metal
band
around
the
projectile,
called
a
"driving
band"
(UK)
or
"rotating
band"
(U.S.).
The
driving
band
is
usually
made
of
copper,
but
synthetic
materials
have
also
been
used.
Smoothbore/Fin-Stabilized
In
modern
artillery
smoothbore
tubes
have
been
used
mostly
by
mortars.
These
projectiles
use
fins
in
the
airflow
at
their
rear
to
maintain
correct
orientation.
The
primary
benefits
over
rifled
barrels
is
reduced
barrel
wear,
longer
ranges
that
can
be
achieved
(due
to
the
reduced
loss
of
energy
to
friction
and
gas
escaping
around
the
projectile
via
the
rifling)
and
larger
explosive
cores
for
a
given
caliber
artillery
due
to
less
metal
needing
to
be
used
to
form
the
case
of
the
projectile
because
of
less
force
applied
to
the
shell
from
the
non-rifled
sides
of
the
barrel
of
smooth
bore
guns.
Rifled/Fin-Stabilized
A
combination
of
the
above
can
be
used,
where
the
barrel
is
rifled,
but
the
projectile
also
has
deployable
fins
for
stabilization,[42]
guidance[43]
or
gliding.[44]
Propellant[edit]
152
mm
howitzer
D-20
during
the
Iran-Iraq
war.
Most
forms
of
artillery
require
a
propellant
to
propel
the
projectile
at
the
target.
Propellant
is
always
a
low
explosive,
this
means
it
deflagrates
instead
of
detonating,
as
with
high
explosives.
The
shell
is
accelerated
to
a
high
velocity
in
a
very
short
time
by
the
rapid
generation
of
gas
from
the
burning
propellant.
This
high
pressure
is
achieved
by
burning
the
propellant
in
a
contained
area,
either
the
chamber
of
a
gun
barrel
or
the
combustion
chamber
of
a
rocket
motor.
Until
the
late
19th
century,
the
only
available
propellant
was
black
powder.
Black
powder
had
many
disadvantages
as
a
propellant;
it
has
relatively
low
power,
requiring
large
amounts
of
powder
to
fire
projectiles,
and
created
thick
clouds
of
white
smoke
that
would
obscure
the
targets,
betray
the
positions
of
guns,
and
make
aiming
impossible.
In
1846,
nitrocellulose
(also
known
as
guncotton)
was
discovered,
and
the
high
explosive
nitroglycerin
was
discovered
at
much
the
same
time.
Nitrocellulose
was
significantly
more
powerful
than
black
powder,
and
was
smokeless.
Early
guncotton
was
unstable,
however,
and
burned
very
fast
and
hot,
leading
to
greatly
increased
barrel
wear.
Widespread
introduction
of
smokeless
powder
would
wait
until
the
advent
of
the
double-base
powders,
which
combine
nitrocellulose
and
nitroglycerin
to
produce
powerful,
smokeless,
stable
propellant.
Many
other
formulations
were
developed
in
the
following
decades,
generally
trying
to
find
the
optimum
characteristics
of
a
good
artillery
propellant;
low
temperature,
high
energy,
non
corrosive,
highly
stable,
cheap,
and
easy
to
manufacture
in
large
quantities.
Broadly,
modern
gun
propellants
are
divided
into
three
classes:
single-base
propellants
which
are
mainly
or
entirely
nitrocellulose
based,
double-base
propellants
composed
of
a
combination
of
nitrocellulose
and
nitroglycerin,
and
triple
base
composed
of
a
combination
of
nitrocellulose
and
nitroglycerin
and
Nitroguanidine.
Artillery
shells
fired
from
a
barrel
can
be
assisted
to
greater
range
in
three
ways:
rocket-assisted
projectiles
(RAP)
enhance
and
sustain
the
projectile's
velocity
by
providing
additional
'push'
from
a
small
rocket
motor
that
is
part
of
the
projectile's
base.
Base
bleed
uses
a
small
pyrotechnic
charge
at
the
base
of
the
projectile
to
introduce
sufficient
combustion
products
into
the
low-pressure
region
behind
the
base
of
the
projectile
responsible
for
a
large
proportion
of
the
drag.
ramjet-assisted,
similar
to
rocket-assisted,
but
using
a
ramjet
instead
of
a
rocket
motor;
it
is
anticipated
that
a
ramjet-assisted
120-mm
mortar
shell
could
reach
a
range
of
22
mi
(35
km).[45]
Propelling
charges
for
tube
artillery
can
be
provided
in
one
of
two
ways:
either
as
cartridge
bags
or
in
metal
cartridge
cases.
Generally,
anti-aircraft
artillery
and
smaller-caliber
(up
to
3"
or
76.2
mm)
guns
use
metal
cartridge
cases
that
include
the
round
and
propellant,
similar
to
a
modern
rifle
cartridge.
This
simplifies
loading
and
is
necessary
for
very
high
rates
of
fire.
Bagged
propellant
allows
the
amount
of
powder
to
be
raised
or
lowered,
depending
on
the
range
to
the
target.
It
also
makes
handling
of
larger
shells
easier.
Each
requires
a
totally
different
type
of
breech
to
the
other.
A
metal
case
holds
an
integral
primer
to
initiate
the
propellant
and
provides
the
gas
seal
to
prevent
the
gases
leaking
out
of
the
breech;
this
is
called
obturation.
With
bagged
charges,
the
breech
itself
provides
obturation
and
holds
the
primer.
In
either
case,
the
primer
is
usually
percussion,
but
electrical
is
also
used,
and
laser
ignition
is
emerging.
Modern
155
mm
guns
have
a
primer
magazine
fitted
to
their
breech.
Battleship
Ammunition:

Artillery
ammunition
has
four
classifications
according
to
use:
Service:
ammunition
used
in
live
fire
training
or
for
wartime
use
in
a
combat
zone.
Also
known
as
"warshot"
ammunition.
Practice:
Ammunition
with
a
non-
or
minimally-explosive
projectile
that
mimics
the
characteristics
(range,
accuracy)
of
live
rounds
for
use
under
training
conditions.
Practice
artillery
ammunition
often
utilizes
a
colored-smoke-generating
bursting
charge
for
marking
purposes
in
place
of
the
normal
high-explosive
charge.
Dummy:
Ammunition
with
an
inert
warhead,
inert
primer,
and
no
propellant;
used
for
training
or
display.
Blank:
Ammunition
with
live
primer,
greatly
reduced
propellant
charge
(typically
black
powder),
and
no
projectile;
used
for
training,
demonstration
or
ceremonial
use.
Field
artillery
system[edit]
Cyclone
of
the
320th
French
Artillery,
in
Hoogstade,
Belgium,
5
September
1917.
Because
field
artillery
mostly
uses
indirect
fire
the
guns
have
to
be
part
of
a
system
that
enables
them
to
attack
targets
invisible
to
them
in
accordance
with
the
combined
arms
plan.
The
main
functions
in
the
field
artillery
system
are:
Communications
Command:
authority
to
allocate
resources;
Target
acquisition:
detect,
identify
and
deduce
the
location
of
targets;
Control:
authority
to
decide
which
targets
to
attack
and
allot
fire
units
to
the
attack;
Computation
of
firing
data
–
to
deliver
fire
from
a
fire
unit
onto
its
target;
Fire
units:
guns,
launchers
or
mortars
grouped
together;
Specialist
services:
produce
data
to
support
the
production
of
accurate
firing
data;
Logistic
services:
to
provide
combat
supplies,
particularly
ammunition,
and
equipment
support.
Organisationally
and
spatially,
these
functions
can
be
arranged
in
many
ways.
Since
the
creation
of
modern
indirect
fire,
different
armies
have
done
it
differently
at
different
times
and
in
different
places.
Technology
is
often
a
factor,
but
so
are
military–social
issues,
the
relationships
between
artillery
and
other
arms,
and
the
criteria
by
which
military
capability,
efficiency,
and
effectiveness
are
judged.
Cost
is
also
an
issue
because
artillery
is
expensive
due
to
the
large
quantities
of
ammunition
that
it
uses
and
its
level
of
manpower.
Communications
underpin
the
artillery
system,
as
it
must
be
reliable
and
available
in
real-time.
During
the
20th
century
communications
often
used
flags,
morse
code
by
radio,
line
and
lights
(which
could
include
voice
and
teleprinter,
to
name
a
few
contrivances).
Radio
has
included
HF,
VHF,
satellite
and
radio
relay
as
well
as
modern
tactical
trunk
systems.
In
western
armies
radio
communications
are
now
usually
encrypted.[citation

The
emergence
of
mobile
and
man-portable
radios
after
World
War
I
had
a
major
impact
on
artillery
because
it
enabled
fast
and
mobile
operations
with
observers
accompanying
the
infantry
or
armoured
troops.
In
World
War
II,
some
armies
fitted
their
self-propelled
guns
with
radios.
However,
sometimes
in
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century,
hardcopy
artillery
fire
plans
and
map
traces
were
distributed.
Data
communications
can
be
especially
important
for
artillery
because
by
using
structured
messages
and
defined
data
types
fire
control
messages
can
be
automatically
routed
and
processed
by
computers.
For
example,
a
target
acquisition
element
can
send
a
message
with
target
details
which
is
automatically
routed
through
the
tactical
and
technical
fire
control
elements
to
deliver
firing
data
to
the
gun's
laying
system
and
the
gun
automatically
laid.
As
tactical
data
networks
become
pervasive,
they
will
provide
any
connected
soldier
with
a
means
for
reporting
target
information
and
requesting
artillery
fire.
Command
is
the
authority
to
allocate
resources,
typically
by
assigning
artillery
formations
or
units.
Terminology
and
its
implications
vary
widely.
However,
very
broadly,
artillery
units
are
assigned
in
direct
support
or
in
general
support.
Typically,
the
former
mostly
provide
close
support
to
manoeuvre
units,
while
the
latter
may
provide
close
support
and
or
depth
fire,
notably
counter-battery.
Generally,
'direct
support'
also
means
that
the
artillery
unit
provides
artillery
observation
and
liaison
teams
to
the
supported
units.
Sometimes,
direct
support
units
are
placed
under
command
of
the
regiment/brigade
they
support.
General
support
units
may
be
grouped
into
artillery
formations;
for
example,
brigades,
even
divisions,
or
multi-battalion
regiments,
and
usually
under
command
of
division,
corps,
or
higher
HQs.
General
support
units
tend
to
be
moved
to
where
they
are
most
required
at
any
particular
time.
Artillery
command
may
impose
priorities
and
constraints
to
support
their
combined
arms
commander's
plans.
Target
acquisition
can
take
many
forms,
it
is
usually
observation
in
real
time,
but
may
be
the
product
of
analysis.
Artillery
observation
teams
are
the
most
common
means
of
target
acquisition.
However,
air
observers
have
been
use
since
the
beginning
of
indirect
fire
and
were
quickly
joined
by
air
photography.
Target
acquisition
may
also
be
by
anyone
that
can
get
the
information
into
the
artillery
system.
Targets
may
be
visible
to
forward
troops
or
in
depth
and
invisible
to
them.
Observation
equipment
can
vary
widely
in
its
complexity.
Unmanned
air
vehicles
are
the
latest
form
of
air
observation,
having
been
first
introduced
in
the
early
1960s.
The
equipment
available
to
observation
teams
has
progressed
from
just
prismatic
compass,
hand-held
or
tripod
mounted
binoculars
and
sometimes
optical
range-finders.
Special
equipment
for
locating
hostile
artillery:
flash
spotting
and
notably
sound
ranging
appeared
in
World
War
I
the
latter
has
been
undergone
increasing
refinement
as
technology
has
improved.
These
were
joined
by
radar
in
World
War
II.
In
the
mid-1970s
several
armies
started
equipping
their
artillery
observation
teams
with
laser
rangefinders,
ground
surveillance
radars
and
night
vision
devices,
these
were
soon
followed
by
inertial
orienting
and
navigating
devices
to
improve
the
accuracy
of
target
locations.
The
Global
Positioning
System
(GPS)
provided
a
smaller
and
cheaper
means
of
quick
and
accurate
fixation
for
target
acquisition
devices.
Specialised
units
with
ground
surveillance
radars,
unattended
ground
sensors
or
observation
patrols
operating
in
depth
have
also
been
used.
Targets
in
depth
may
also
be
'acquired'
by
intelligence
processes
using
various
sources
and
agencies
such
as
HUMINT,
SIGINT,
ELINT
and
IMINT.
Laser
guided
shells
require
laser
target
designators,
usually
with
observation
teams
on
the
ground
but
UAV
installations
are
possible.
Specialised
artillery
observation
vehicles
appeared
in
World
War
II
and
have
greatly
increased
in
sophistication
since
that
time.
Control,
sometimes
called
tactical
fire
control,
is
primarily
concerned
with
'targeting'
and
the
allotment
of
fire
units
to
targets.
This
is
vital
when
a
target
is
within
range
of
many
fire
units
and
the
number
of
fire
units
needed
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
target,
and
the
circumstances
and
purpose
of
its
engagement.
Targeting
is
concerned
with
selecting
the
right
weapons
in
the
right
quantities
to
achieve
the
required
effects
on
the
target.
Allotment
attempts
to
address
the
artillery
dilemma—important
targets
are
rarely
urgent
and
urgent
targets
are
rarely
important.
Of
course
importance
is
a
matter
of
perspective;
what
is
important
to
a
divisional
commander
is
rarely
the
same
as
what
is
important
to
an
infantry
platoon
commander.

Broadly,
there
are
two
situations:
fire
against
opportunity
targets,
and
targets
whose
engagement
is
planned
as
part
of
a
particular
operation.
In
the
latter
situation,
command
assigns
fire
units
to
the
operation
and
an
overall
artillery
fire
planner
makes
a
plan,
possibly
delegating
resources
for
some
parts
of
it
to
other
planners.
Fire
plans
may
also
involve
use
of
non-artillery
assets,
such
as
mortars
and
aircraft.
Control
of
fire
against
opportunity
targets
is
an
important
differentiator
between
different
types
of
artillery
system.
In
some
armies,
only
designated
artillery
HQs
have
the
tactical
fire
control
authority
to
order
fire
units
to
engage
a
target,
all
'calls
for
fire'
being
requests
to
these
HQs.
This
authority
may
also
extend
to
deciding
the
type
and
quantity
of
ammunition
to
be
used.
In
other
armies,
an
'authorised
observer'
(for
example,
artillery
observation
team
or
other
target
acquisition
element)
can
order
fire
units
to
engage.
In
the
latter
case,
a
battery
observation
team
can
order
fire
to
their
own
battery
and
may
be
authorised
to
order
fire
to
their
own
battalion,
and
sometimes
to
many
battalions.
For
example,
a
divisional
artillery
commander
may
authorise
selected
observers
to
order
fire
to
the
entire
divisional
artillery.
When
observers
or
cells
are
not
authorised,
they
can
still
request
fire.
Armies
that
apply
forward
tactical
control
generally
put
the
majority
of
the
more
senior
officers
of
artillery
units
forward
in
command
observation
posts
or
with
the
supported
arm.
Those
that
do
not
use
this
approach
tend
to
put
these
officers
close
to
the
guns.
In
either
case,
the
observation
element
usually
controls
fire
in
detail
against
the
target,
such
as
adjusting
it
onto
the
target,
moving
it,
and
coordinating
it
with
the
supported
arm
as
necessary
to
achieve
the
required
effects.
Firing
data
has
to
be
calculated
and
is
the
key
to
indirect
fire;
the
arrangements
for
this
have
varied
widely.
In
the
end,
firing
data
has
two
components:
quadrant
elevation
and
azimuth,
to
these
may
be
added
the
size
of
propelling
charge
and
the
fuze
setting.
The
process
to
produce
firing
data
is
sometimes
called
technical
fire
control.
Before
computers,
some
armies
set
the
range
on
the
gun's
sights,
which
mechanically
corrected
it
for
the
gun's
muzzle
velocity.
For
the
first
few
decades
of
indirect
fire,
the
firing
data
were
often
calculated
by
the
observer,
who
then
adjusted
the
fall
of
shot
onto
the
target.
However,
the
need
to
engage
targets
at
night,
in
depth,
or
hit
the
target
with
the
first
rounds
quickly
led
to
predicted
fire
being
developed
in
World
War
I.
Predicted
fire
existed
alongside
the
older
method.
After
World
War
II,
predicted
methods
were
invariably
applied,
but
the
fall
of
shot
usually
needed
adjustment
because
of
inaccuracy
in
locating
the
target,
the
proximity
of
friendly
troops,
or
the
need
to
engage
a
moving
target.
Target
location
errors
were
significantly
reduced
once
laser
rangefinders,
orientation,
and
navigation
devices
were
issued
to
observation
parties.
In
predicted
fire,
the
basic
geospatial
data
of
range,
angle
of
sight,
and
azimuth
between
a
fire
unit
and
its
target
was
produced
and
corrected
for
variations
from
the
'standard
conditions'.
These
variations
included
barrel
wear,
propellant
temperature,
different
projectiles
weights
that
all
affected
the
muzzle
velocity,
and
air
temperature,
density,
wind
speed
&
direction,
and
rotation
of
the
Earth
that
affect
the
shell
in
flight.
The
net
effect
of
variations
can
also
be
determined
by
shooting
at
an
accurately
known
point,
a
process
called
'registration'.
All
these
calculations
to
produce
a
quadrant
elevation
(or
range)
and
azimuth
were
done
manually
by
highly
trained
soldiers
using
instruments,
tabulated
data,
data
of
the
moment,
and
approximations
until
battlefield
computers
started
appearing
in
the
1960s
and
'70s.
While
some
early
calculators
copied
the
manual
method
(typically
substituting
polynomials
for
tabulated
data),
computers
use
a
different
approach.
They
simulate
a
shell's
trajectory
by
'flying'
it
in
short
steps
and
applying
data
about
the
conditions
affecting
the
trajectory
at
each
step.
This
simulation
is
repeated
until
it
produces
a
quadrant
elevation
and
azimuth
that
lands
the
shell
within
the
required
'closing'
distance
of
the
target
coordinates.

Technical
fire
control
has
been
performed
in
various
places,
but
mostly
in
firing
batteries.
However,
in
the
1930s,
the
French
moved
it
to
battalion
level
and
combined
it
with
some
tactical
fire
control.
This
was
copied
by
the
US.
Nevertheless,
most
armies
seemed
to
have
retained
it
within
firing
batteries,
and
some
duplicated
the
technical
fire
control
teams
in
a
battery
to
give
operational
resilience
and
tactical
flexibility.
Computers
reduced
the
number
of
men
needed
and
enabled
decentralisation
of
technical
fire
control
to
autonomous
sub-battery
fire
units,
such
as
platoons,
troops,
or
sections,
although
some
armies
had
sometimes
done
this
with
their
manual
methods.
Computation
on
the
gun
or
launcher,
integrated
with
their
laying
system,
is
also
possible.

A
fire
unit
is
the
smallest
artillery
or
mortar
element,
consisting
of
one
or
more
weapon
systems,
capable
of
being
employed
to
execute
a
fire
assigned
by
a
tactical
fire
controller.
Generally
it
is
a
battery,
but
sub-divided
batteries
are
quite
common,
and
in
some
armies
very
common.
On
occasions
a
battery
of
6
guns
has
been
6
fire
units.
Fire
units
may
or
may
not
occupy
separate
positions.
Geographically
dispersed
fire
units
may
or
may
not
have
an
integral
capability
for
technical
fire
control.
Specialist
services
provide
data
need
for
predicted
fire.
Increasingly,
they
are
provided
from
within
firing
units.
These
services
include:
Survey:
accurate
fixation
and
orientation
of
the
guns,
historically
this
involved
specialists
within
field
artillery
units
and
specialist
units.
In
some
armies
mapping
and
amp
supply
has
also
been
an
artillery
responsibility.
Survey
is
also
essential
for
some
target
acquisition
devices.
Traditional
survey
methods
of
measurement
and
calculation
have
been
replaced
by
inertial
orientation
and
navigators
and
GPS.
Meteorological
data:
historically
these
were
usually
divisional
level
specialist
teams
but
advances
in
technology
mean
they
are
now
increasingly
part
of
artillery
units.
Calibration:
periodically
establishing
the
"normal"
muzzle
velocity
of
each
gun
as
it
wears.
Originally
this
involved
special
facilities
and
army
level
teams.
Measurement
using
Doppler
radar,
introduced
in
the
1950s,
started
to
simplify
arrangements.
Some
armies
now
have
a
muzzle
velocity
measuring
radar
permanently
fitted
to
every
gun.
Logistic
services,
supply
of
artillery
ammunition
has
always
been
a
major
component
of
military
logistics.
Up
until
World
War
I
some
armies
made
artillery
responsible
for
all
forward
ammunition
supply
because
the
load
of
small
arms
ammunition
was
trivial
compared
to
artillery.
Different
armies
use
different
approaches
to
ammunition
supply,
which
can
vary
with
the
nature
of
operations.
Differences
include
where
the
logistic
service
transfers
artillery
ammunition
to
artillery,
the
amount
of
ammunition
carried
in
units
and
extent
to
which
stocks
are
held
at
unit
or
battery
level.
A
key
difference
is
whether
supply
is
'push'
or
'pull'.
In
the
former
the
'pipeline'
keeps
pushing
ammunition
into
formations
or
units
at
a
defined
rate.
In
the
latter
units
fire
as
tactically
necessary
and
replenish
to
maintain
or
reach
their
authorised
holding
(which
can
vary),
so
the
logistic
system
has
to
be
able
to
cope
with
surge
and
slack.
Artillery
has
always
been
equipment
intensive
and
for
centuries
artillery
provided
its
own
artificers
to
maintain
and
repair
their
equipment.
Most
armies
now
place
these
services
in
specialist
branches
with
specialist
repair
elements
in
batteries
and
units.
Classification
of
artillery[edit]
Artillery
types
can
be
categorised
in
several
ways,
for
example
by
type
or
size
of
weapon
or
ordnance,
by
role
or
by
organizational
arrangements.
Types
of
ordnance[edit]
The
types
of
cannon
artillery
are
generally
distinguished
by
the
velocity
at
which
they
fire
projectiles.
